       "  'Текст отзыва': \"There are some great WW1 films out there, the granddaddy of them all in my view being 1930's 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. Also appreciate many of the actors here, though they are in cameo roles, and Sam Mendes as a director (of the films of his seen, almost all, 'Spectre' is the only one to not do much for me). Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman are masters in their field, Deakins is one of the best cinematographers in the business and Newman's score for 'Road to Perdition' is a favourite.'1917' was seen for all those reasons. As well as because of the critical acclaim, with it being considered as one of 2019's year's best films. After seeing it, my thoughts are that the acclaim for '1917' is richly deserved in one of the best and most powerful films that year. It did connect a lot with me, due to watching it not long after reading the harrowing war diaries of my great-grandfather (who fought in the war and was mustard gassed and blinded).First and foremost, '1917' is a visual and technical achievement. It is beautifully and evocatively designed and Deakins' cinematography, with awe-inspiring and never gimmicky use of the long unbroken one take technique, is nothing short of masterful. Mendes ensures that the tension, even in the slower moments, never slips, keeping the intensity (at its best almost nerve-shredding) going.Newman provides another hauntingly beautiful score, that does stir the emotions in the latter parts of the film when things become more urgent. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity, so much so it was like being there. The film is intelligently scripted and to me the two lead characters, especially Scofield, were easy to get behind, interesting and their bond came over as realistic. The story is engrossing throughout, it briefly loses a little momentum just before the climax perhaps, but the first half is emotionally powerful and the climax is unpredictably intense.Such a good job is done too with showing the full horrors of war from a visual standpoint, a psychological one and in the unflinching action. Without going too far, the point of view not being hammered home. '1917' benefits hugely from the splendid lead performance of George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman is strong too despite his role not being quite as meaty. The cameos from Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Richard Madden and Andrew Scott manage to make big impressions in short screen time.Overall, brilliant and powerful film. One of the best films personally watched in 2020. 10/10.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The command has realized that the Germans have pulled back for a trap on a British offensive. The telephone lines are cut, and the only way to get the orders through to the colonel commanding the offensive is to send two soldiers through the lines. One of them has special incentive. His elder brother is a soldier in the attack. If it goes through, 1600 men, will be wiped out for no purpose.... including the soldier's brother.It's a classic story-telling format that dates back to the ANABASIS: get from point A to Point B, only here it's just two men traveling through the alternating inferno of the Great War's front lines, and the bucolic springtime of northern France. Effective as that is, director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have shot it, as near as they could manage, as one long take - after I had realized what they were doing, about twenty minutes into the film, I began to look for ways of editing things together. While I spotted a few, there was really only one obvious spot, and that was after more than an hour had passed.This deliberate effort to make this movie in this manner clearly has a point. It is a constant barrage, one long cinematic sentence that must be swallowed whole. It forces the viewer to take it all in in one piece, giving, perhaps, a hint of the overwhelming sensory overload of this struggle to get through.It certainly worked on me.\"},\n",

A minimum of 34 discreet edits were subtly introduced to create the illusion of a continuous shot. This prompts speculation about the extent of the set, given the limited number of cuts, particularly within a wartime backdrop.Transitioning to the narrative and cast evaluation, the film embarks on a riveting journey. The ensemble, including delivers a commendable performance. The artistic nuances employed to bolster the script, characters, pivotal moments, and conflicts resonate as an exquisite touch.The film doesn't merely captivate with its story but also portrays a natural splendor, subtly showcasing its essence.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Sam Mendes' war drama is set during World War I and very personal to him, as it tells a story his grandfather used to tell him when he was still a young lad. Dedicated to Mendes' hero, this drama cuts deep when we join two young soldiers on a mission to deliver a message that could possibly save thousands of fellow combatants.Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.Roger Deakins' (Blade Runner 2049) cinematography is once again breathtakingly superior to anything else you've seen this year, and for sure will be the one thing people unanimously praise. Sound editing/mixing, visual effects and production design are all outstanding. These are the things, people will remember. It is Thomas Newman's (Passengers) score that elevates every moment happening in front of you, intensifying the emotions brought by our main characters. And although MacKay (Captain Fantastic) and Chapman (Game of Thrones) do a pretty phenomenal job at capturing the true essence of their characters going through a literal hell, it's the side characters with little-to-no screen time who steal their spotlight. Andrew Scott (Fleabag), Mark Strong (Shazam!), Richard Madden (Rocketman) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Dr. Strange) are checkpoints along the way, but man, do they impress with the few lines they're given.1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Saving Private Ryan, 30 Seconds over Tokyo, Patton, Inglorious Bastards, The Great Escape and Schindler's List are only a few of the countless movies about World War II that have been made. In fact, many are still made today. So why haven't there been a lot of movies about the first World War? I think it comes down to exactly what was being fought for and what it meant for everyone. Everyone can agree that Nazism is bad and running a nation as a dictatorship robs everyone of their freedom. Germany was a common enemy that everyone would want to fight, similar to a simple film's goal of good against evil.While World War I may have not had a simple enemy to get behind, it's still an important war as it collapsed several European empires, set the stage for a revolution in Russia, put the U. S. in a larger military position and unfortunately led to the deaths of millions. What movies can do is really put us in the position of those solders to see the magnitude of warfare and it's path of devastation. This may make 1917 one of the most intense movies to sit through, but an important one to witness.In the misty month of April in 1917, English soldiers are resting after seeing the Germans pulling back from the western front. Two solders, Blake (played by Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (played by George MacKay) are assigned to deliver a message to another Battalion. They receive more information from General Erinmore (played by Colin Firth), where they find out that the 2nd Battalion , which is assuming an easy victory, is about to walk into a deadly battle with most of the German offensive attacking there. With the phone lines cut, both Blake and Schofield are instructed to cross No Man's Land to find the Battalion and deliver a message to not attack.Plot wise, that's all you need to know about 1917. The rest of the movie follows these two men as they cross over the horror that is No Man's Land, abandoned German trenches and everything else that would scare any soldier crossing the lines. What separates this from a lot of other war movies is that the entire film is created to appear that everything is done in one continuous shot, never taking the perspective away from the main characters. This also includes time and light, depending whether it's day or night.Even with it's ambition, 1917 is still a phenomenal movie that's an experience that gave my heart a large rush. Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Skyfall) clearly wanted to give audiences the best way to experience the trenches and gunshots and did so through this one shot story. Birdman may have done something similar, but given how many extras and special effects went off, I would love to see a behind the scenes look at how everything was done. The cinematography pays a lot of detail to little things like the color of the sky during sunrise and how much paler skin would become after death.The story feels a lot like something out of theme park or a video game...and I mean that in a good way. You're aware that your watching someone else's experience , but the right angles do make you feel like you're a part of it. Where 1917 endures in the story is it's simple goal while going through several layers of warfare Hell. I could see this getting boring quick, but despite it's one shot goal, every scene still has a different look that never feels too familiar. The movie knows not to stop for too long unless it was for an important reason. It's a rush.Does this movie into the bigger political or social impact of World War I? No, but that was never the intention. It's like watching someone's small story that is large in scale. If I did have any problems is that there's a point where a character is knocked out and he's awoken. I won't say where, but it broke part of the spell that the movie put me in. You can tell it's a point where they were hiding an edit, but if the movie had a bunch of them in plain sight, you'd think they could have done better.I'll give this eight dogfight planes out of ten. Like a lot of war movies, this isn't a pleasant experience. It isn't supposed to be; it's meant to be a tool to really give you something that a lot of people have forgotten about as WWI movies aren't made a lot. I highly recommend this if your willing to see something that I can't say I could make myself.\"},\n",

It brings the technical excellence of Dunkirk, with great war sets and brutally realistic depictions of the intensity of war, but intelligently turns to a humanist angle in telling a simple story of two men trying to help their country's men. There are no bad elements of 1917, but it's the phenomenal execution of the one-shot technique that makes it great. The tracking shots in the trenches made me realize how much less immersive it is to be constantly cut to the front of the next shot, rather than seeing the path the characters take. Given that it's this one epic journey, it is fitting to go on it with Schofield the whole way. The colors and big war shots (especially Schofield running across the war zone to reach the captain and him jumping into the river) were gorgeous. The score is essential, ratcheting tension up quickly in scenes like the rat trip wire and also calming it down in personal scenes like one character's death and when Schofield meets the baby and woman. War is so extreme and all-encompassing that it's truly difficult for any film to accurately capture it, but 1917 belongs up there with the best efforts. It is a film of brutality and loyalty, but above all it's a beautiful work of art about one of the ugliest subjects known to man.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Last night COL Ferry and I (COL Coldwell, both USA) were able to watch the new WWI film, 1917, before it has national release. It is a cinematographic feast for the eyes, long expansive shots that follow the protagonists as they execute their mission. It does not hide the horrors that existed in trench warfare, it shows them for their brutality and abundance. (My great uncle died as a consequence of his service fighting in the trenches, mustard gas poisoning). In many ways it reminded me of Saving Private Ryan.For those who have served in combat (I have deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan), I cannot tell you if the film will be too difficult to watch, it might well be, especially if incoming artillery is a trigger. For me, as the camera travels a few inches above the dirt advancing slowly up a berm, my response was visceral. I was taken back to the patrols we walked in Afghanistan, not knowing what was around the corner; not relaxing heightened vigilance, not knowing if there would be an IED, a child wearing a suicide vest, a sniper taking aim. For the protagonists in this film (as for all who served and are serving) surviving the climb up the berm, there is no sigh of relief, no respite from the fear of uncertainty. They (we) survive to move forward to face more uncertainty.Watching allowed me to pay homage to my great uncle, and the approximate 800,000 other Brits who were killed or died as a consequence of their service. (Germany lost over 2 million soldiers in the war). Estimates put the total casualty numbers for both military and civilians at 40 million, half killed or died from wounds/infection.I rate this film as 10/10, for many reasons. Directing, acting, set design, cinematography, musical score, the raw emotion it invokes. Some critics have said they never felt a connection with the characters, I suspect they never served in combat. While the brotherhood (including female War Fighters) is strong, there is also a common characteristic possessed by all War Fighters, the ability to focus on a mission and suppress emotion, even as those around the Fighter fall. This was the quality I recognized in the actors and why the viewer doesn\\'t \"bond\" with the main protagonists; we, the viewer, were on the mission with them, we grieve as we can and move on.Watch if you will, but know there is no pleasure in watching and the film will grab you and the beginning and not let you go. Even though we know the outcome of WWI, there is no joy, there is no peace. Watch because it will allow you a glimpse at the horror and brutality of war; reflect on their service and sacrifice. Note, as we (the viewer) are \"walking\" through the trenches, glancing shots of the young soldiers shows them with flat affect, isolation, almost apathy; this is the face of \"shell shock,\" what we know call post-traumatic stress disorder.For original WW1 footage, watch \"They Shall Never Grow Old,\" an exceptional documentary.'},\n",

Wasn't sure if I was going to like that that approach to filming but it worked for this film.The movie looked fantastic and the scenes and shots were breath taking. Sound and music score really helped a viewer on an emotional level as well.While I was engrossed and drawn into this film from start to finish, after it was over and I had time to reflect on it, I found it not the profound masterpiece others have stated it as.The plot in general was unrealistic - there are better ways to deliver a message than sending two soldiers across enemy lines and relying on luck and hope.Some of the scenes dragged as well, which caused the movie to lose momentum for me. Felt the build up often yes, but then there would be scene that made me lose interest (truck ride. French woman & baby).Acting wasn't spectacular either, from anyone in the film. You can have all the explosions and battle scenes you want that look great, but if the actors can't carry the script along it won't work as a whole. This is why the comparisons that mention Saving Private Ryan don't work for me - those actors drew you in with their performances. That didn't happen here, and between the acting and the momentum losing scenes, is why I cant rate this film any higher.Close, but missed the mark for a perfect film, but a good watch none the less.\"},\n",

The hell of the WWI battlefield is a subject that hasn't been covered in a long time and Mr. Mendes executes this perfectly. A movie like this couldn't have been made 50 years ago but with today's advances in film making along with a large studio budget Mr. Mendes takes us through an adventure every bit as harrowing as Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line.The use of the single shot was brilliant as it brings the viewer along in the trenches and further adds to the realism to the film. I was surprised to hear that this was gimmicky effect from some critics, I feel Mr. Mendes nailed it brilliantly with the help of some fantastic cinematography. The set pieces were so realistic and detailed, a lesser director would've focused more on them but for this ride the camera never stops moving and it's a benefit to the film.There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film. The dialogue was great and certainly was a key component of making the single shot method work here. There is no pointless exposition in the movie.This isn't a piece to glorify war but rather demonstrate how one can be brave all the while showing their vulnerabilities and fear that any normal person would feel in that type of situation. There are no gratuitous bits in the film to exemplify heroism, just a simple story that allows the characters to shine and define bravery on their own terms.From the acting, to the score, to the cinematography, editing and overall direction of the film Mr. Mendes absolutely knocked it out of the park. This isn't just one of the best war movies of all time, I believe it's truly one of the best pieces of film to ever grace the big screen. 1917 will leave you breathless and for many like myself, in tears when the journey comes to and end.Bravo!!\"},\n",

As you probably know, it's supposed to consist of one continuous 2-hour shot. Hitchcock, eat your heart out.Nearly 500 rank-and-file digital artists alone might tell you different, and I'd be interested to learn about the size of the camera disk drive they used, if it was 'one take'.Emotionally, 1917 is suspenseful, scary, shocking, sad, exciting, nightmarish, and yet: your engagement with the two main characters is more to do with 'what will be thrown at these actors next?', rather than 'what will happen to this person I really care about?'It's like watching someone play a massively multiplayer online WWI game, with graphics and camera movement that blows the competition away because it's actually staged. It's not like feeling anger at the stupidity of war, or feeling grief at the deaths of thousands over a pointless dispute between royal cousins - any Germans certainly get a very rough ride from the script.1917 is impressive in the way 'Saving Private Ryan' was impressive, but not as moving in the way 'Paths Of Glory' and many others were emotionally moving.Ten stars for technique, five for throwing money at a series of old soldiers' gory tales without any more context than, 'Wow, look at this!!'\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"It features a realistic portrayal of a true remarkable story following the appalling journey of two soldiers having to call off the attack against Germany.1917 is a massive technical achievement done right. The camera tracks this pair of individuals with a smooth good-looking one continuous shot for 110 mins! Despite it's not exactly one shot, the slick technique where it manages to trick the audience's eyes when a one shot jumps from the other is brilliant.Cinematography is riveting to the eyes. There are so many important close-ups that picture a thousand words of these two soldiers about their past and their emotional trauma of the World War 1 effect. The better thing is it knows when to pull back from those close-ups to reveal the true scale of the horrendous and the shock of the battlefield.Immersively done, 1917 sucks you into the sheer horror of experiencing the daunting moments of World War 1. You will feel as if you are walking with these men.1917 is a highly suspenseful film from the front 'till the end of the line. I can assure you, the intensity is greater than 90% horror movies in the last decade. Sam Mendes escalates the tense atmosphere little by little before he uncovers everything in the final 20 minutes.The set feels very much like a breath of air back in the early 1900s. It is unrelenting seeing objects, locations and soldiers are bombed into pieces, excellently enhanced by how specific the layouts are to justify the maddening era of bloodbath.Though feels gimmicky, the music projects a powerful influence in increasing the gritty war moments and giving the sense that every scene should be appreciated as much as possible.George Mackay & Dean Chapman's performances are great however, I wish they could give more. The former expresses his raw emotions clearly but sometimes, he falls flat and the latter's way of characters feels quite unbelievable due to Chapman's failure to construct expressions that is substantially connected to the impacts of war. For mega-awards like Golden Globe & Oscar, the lack of creativity to create nuances details on their face, resulted in them not nominated for Best Actor/Supporting Actor.1917 renders much of a survival movie like Dunkirk rather than non-stopping war shootings genre. The plot is where the downside comes. Mind that it is great and propulsively executed but the emptiness of the sub-stories is what 1917 suffers.1917 also hurts by putting in dialogues that does not drive the story further, but only to give a sense of what personality the characters embody.Verdict: 1917 is a warfare that feels immersive and nerve-wracking with its glorious cinematography and visual designs however, it occasionally steps into the landmines which is forgivable as the whole movie transmits an experience that is substantially novelty and worth living for.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Impressively filmed, the movie's staging, set design, lighting, cinematography and choreographed action sequences are all top notch and deserving of recognition. I should mention the soundtrack as well, which complements the story as two young soldiers progress their way through No Man's land to deliver an urgent message to a distant unit that faces annihilation. The film makers wisely selected two relatively lesser know actors for the film's protagonists so that celebrity wouldn't get in the way of the story. I was somewhat surprised that Dean-Charles Chapman, portraying Lance Corporal Blake, didn't make it to the end of the movie. His death before mid-picture left Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) the unenviable task of making his way alone across enemy held territory to complete an almost impossible mission. Among a number of astonishing scenes, I was most impressed with the German plane crash that came within inches of claiming the lives of both men. Though the picture claims it's status as being filmed in one continuous tracking shot, there appear at least one or two instances where that might not have been the case, one in particular being quite obvious, even if masked rather well. Even so, the technique may very well earn Sam Mendes the Best Directing Oscar, along with Cinematography and Production Design. The trenches and battleground scenes are particularly impressive, especially near the finale in which the British unit prepares for it's assault. In any case, the picture stands as a worthy achievement in film making, and is especially recommended.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I have just viewed the film that WILL WIN the Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Cinematography (and probably many, many more).Yes, 1917 is that good.A tour-de-force presentation of a film, 1917 tells the tale of 2 soldiers in WW 1 that are tasked with bringing a message across \"no man\\'s land\" to prevent a company of soldiers from walking into an ambush.Director Sam Mendes (SKYFALL) chose to shoot this film in such a way as to give the impression that this film is just one long shot. While it is not (he shot it in about 8 minute bursts), the choreography of the action is staged in such a way that the cuts are seamless and unnoticeable. It is a master class in Directing from Mendes, for - though it is an interesting \"gimmick\" that puts us (literally) in the shoes (and steps) of the 2 young soldiers on their mission - this gimmick does not get in the way of the film. It helps and enhances the film, you can sit back in your chair and forget about \"the gimmick\" and just get wrapped up, emotionally, in the story that is being told.And...getting wrapped up, emotionally, you will be. For the story, events, struggles and triumphs of these 2 soldiers are brilliantly brought to the screen from Director Mendes and Cinematograper-extraordinaire Roger Deakins (14 time Oscar nominee - from SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION to his win, finally, in BLADE RUNNER 2049). These 2 (and their crew) suck you into the action and tensions of the situation. You feel every step that these soldiers take.Since you spend the entire movie with them, Mendes has done a tremendous job of casting 2 charismatic (but not overly so) actors as the 2 soldiers. Dean-Charles Chapman (Tommen Baratheon in GAME OF THRONES) is determined, focused and single-minded as the lead soldier on this trek - he has personal stakes in this mission - as his brother is in the invasion force that is going to be ambushed. Chapman does a nice job of finding the balance - and making a true person - out of a character that has a single, over-arching mission. It is strong subtle work.But, to me, the standout in this film is George MacKay (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC) as the buddy who is \"brought along\". This could have been just another \"reluctant war hero\" character, but MacKay brings a sense of decency and vulnerability to the early scenes of his character (where he could have just as easily played the \"reluctant companion\"). These nuanced character dimensions take root later on in the film and elevate this actor - and this role - above the norm.Mendes brings in a \"who\\'s who\" of modern British acting stars to fill important extended cameo roles - Colin Firth, Andrew Scott, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch all bring gravitas and heft to their brief appearances on screen.This is not the fastest paced film you will ever see - and I think that this serves the film well. It earns its pace and I was drawn in, emotionally, in a way that would not have worked had Mendes rushed the pace (especially early on).But this film (and Mendes and Deakins) shines during the battle scenes. Even though we are following 2 foot soldiers, they set up the boundaries of these battles in such a way that you understand what is going on - and what is at stake - at least to the 2 soldiers we are following. It is in these scenes that this film really finds its footing. I was drawn even further into the intimate, emotional stakes of these characters at those moments.A marvelous piece of film making that shows a Director and Cinematographer at the top of their games.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)'},\n",

When you're moving fast through a trench system tempers are short when you bump into troopers, they are likely bereaved of friends, seeing their mates lose limbs. Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are on a mission to inform two isolated battalions of the Devonshires to call off an attack due the next morning, the Devons will be advancing into a trap. The stakes are higher for Blake, his brother is in one of the battalions. The messengers cross no mans land, bodies caught on the barbed wire, rats gnawing on corpses, dodging snipers, booby-traps once they reach the abandoned German trenches. Watching an aerial dogfight. This is truly a journey into the heart of darkness for Blake and Schofield.Wonderfully filmed by Roger Deakins in subdued colours with shades of brown, tan, green and khaki predominating as the soldiers progress through the mud and fields. Also some great scenes underground and in shelled out buildings lit by flares. The script is spare but gripping as not just MacKay and Chapman put in great performances; there are also great supporting turns by Mark Strong, Colin Firth , Nabhaan Rizwan and Benedict Cumberbatch.

And in the tradition of the best war movies, 1917 does this exceptionally well while still delivering the thrills and tense moments one expects from this type of cinema. I don't remember being this affected by a war movie since probably SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (to which, in a small way, this owes a small debt). When it comes down to it, Marvel and DC and all the others can keep their world-at-stake existential crises because the intimacy and emotional gravitas of personal relationships is where it's at. This is filmmaking on a human scale.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"On April 6, 1917 in northern France, two British soldiers are assigned to deliver a message to another British regiment requesting that they call off an attack against German soldiers: an attack that would jeopardize the lives of those in the regiment. Lance Corporals William Schofield (George MacKay) and Thomas Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) face much difficulty and danger during their journey.It is said that the entire film (just under two hours) was done in only two long takes. I counted three but who cares? What is most important is the uniquely, brilliant execution of this film. The perfectly long and detailed takes are praiseworthy enough; but to include so much secondary action in the background without errors places this film in the masterpiece category.The cast lives up to the high standard as well with MacKay truly standing out. There is also a moving scene in which a lieutenant (Richard Madden) begins to gradually decipher that he is receiving bad news only by reading the silent face on the man in front of him. The camera shows only the back of the other man while Madden's face progressively registers a series of emotions followed by an obligation to repress them and get on with his duties. This is probably the most poignant moment in this great movie that has many of them.Director Sam Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins have created a thrilling work with real-time intensity. It is gripping and moving all the way while paying tribute to those who made great sacrifices in World War I. - dbamateurcriticRATING: * * * *OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Sam MendesCinematography by Roger Deakins\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Written bySam MendesandKrysty Wilson-Cairns, and directed by Mendes, unless you've been living under a rock, you'll know that 1917 has been done in such a way as to give the impression that it all takes place in two single shots (the marketing material says one shot, but it's two - there's a cut-to-black/time-jump about midway through where no attempt is made to hide the transition). In reality, of course, there are a lot more than two shots (the longest single shot was just over 8 minutes), but the edits have been digitally 'hidden', much likeBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014)orUtøya 22. juli (2018). Working with cinematographerRoger Deakins(who'll win his second Oscar for the film), Mendes wanted it to be the most immersive war movie ever put on screen. And although I have some issues with it, I think he's made an exceptional film, one in which form and content are unusually tightly matched, with the style extremely effective at delivering the story in a thematically justified manner.April 6, 1917; the Western Front. Two British Lance Corporals, Will Schofield (George MacKay) and Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are summoned to a meeting with General Erinmore (Colin Firth). Recently, German forces have fallen back, and Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) of the 2nd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment believes that if he attacks now, he can turn the tide of the war. However, he's unaware that the retreat is tactical - the Germans have fallen back to the heavily fortified Hindenburg Line and are lying in wait. With communication lines cut, Schofield and Blake are assigned to physically carry an order from Erinmore to Mackenzie calling off the following morning's attack. If they fail, 1,600 soldiers will be slaughtered.So, the film's big selling point is its aesthetic design. The use of the single-shot format is such a noticeable type of form that whenever it's used, it automatically places pressure on the content, which must justify why the film is shot this way. If the content can't do that, the form becomes gimmicky. Think of, for example,Rope (1948), which was edited to look like one shot, orVictoria (2015), which was legitimately one shot. Very little in either film justifies the stylistic design. Compare this with genuine one-shot films such asTimecode (2000)orRusskiy kovcheg (2002), and edited one-shot films such asLa casa muda (2010)or the aforementioned Utøya 22. Juli, all of which tie form to content in such a way that they become indistinguishable. And I think Mendes achieves like synergy.Is the one-shot effect distracting? At first, yes, it is a little, especially if you're playing the game of trying to spot where editorLee Smithhas hidden the transitions. But after sussing two edits in the first twenty minutes, I stopped looking, because I realised I was just pulling myself out of the film unnecessarily. In essence, once you go with the aesthetic on its own terms, you forget about trying to spot the edits, instead letting the cinematography do exactly what it's supposed to do - immerse you.Generally speaking, the majority of the film is shot in one of two ways - either the camera is behind Schofield and Blake, following their path, or it's in front of them, facing back towards them as they 'follow' its path. There are some minor deviations from this, but the film never leaves their presence. And because the two men are almost perpetually in motion, it means that the camera is almost perpetually in motion - if they're walking along a trench, we're walking along a trench; if they're moving slowly through a bombed-out town, we're moving slowly through a bombed-out town. Almost everything the camera does is because one or both of the protagonists are doing the same thing, further emphasising the correlation between form and content.The opening scene serves as a superb introduction to the technique. The film starts with a shot of a daffodil field, before pulling back and revealing Schofield and Blake taking a break. They rouse themselves and begin walking, first past more resting soldiers, then the mess, then down a ramp into the trenches. Geographically, it's a short walk, but thematically, it covers considerable ground, and perfectly encapsulates one of the main thematic reasons behind the single-shot - to accurately convey the importance of geospatial relations. We see the tactile transition from Edenic to hellish because we're moving in real-time through the milieu; we see the boundary between peace and war because the characters walk along that boundary. You shoot this sequence conventionally, and you undercut that.Along slightly more conventional lines, one also has to commend the work of production designerDennis Gassner. Every location is visually unique - from a German bunker to an abandoned farmhouse to the bombed-out remnants of Écoust-Saint-Mein. His design of No Man's Land is especially laudable. When the men first crawl venture out, they immediately encounter a rotting fly-covered horse carcass. Gradually, however, the battlefield becomes more mechanised, until they eventually pass through a German artillery position, with their journey charting the progression of the conflict itself, which started on horses and ended up in tanks.Also in a slightly more conventional sense, one has to mention Deakins's work during the nighttime scenes in Écoust-Saint-Mein. The entire village has been reduced to nothing but the shells of buildings, and as we pass through the town, the only source of light is from the flares arching through the sky, which create very hard shadows in constant motion. The whole thing is almost otherworldly, and as the garish light traverses the sky, it's as if the ground itself is in motion, almost liquid-like. It might be a little too aesthetically beautiful for a film aiming for such gritty realism, but for aspiring cinematographers, you won't find a better study in how to compose a sequence using light and shadow.Thematically, by its very nature, 1917 is far more focused on the micro than the macro - you might learn something about life on the front, but you'll learn nothing about the politics behind the conflict. Partly because of this, it avoids, for the most part, the overwrought patriotism and cartoonish jingoism that make films likeSaving Private Ryan (1998)so obnoxious. Indeed, the protagonists' nationality is largely anonymous, which is not something you can usually say of a war film. On the other hand, you shouldn't expect too much psychological insight.The Thin Red Line (1998)(for my money, the greatest war film ever made) it most definitely isn't. Having said that, however, I would value its simple individualised insights above something like the empty temporal trickery ofDunkirk (2017).In terms of other problems, the story is unquestionably paper-thin, but that's pretty much by design. One criticism I did have, however, is how well-groomed Scholfield and Blake constantly are, each with a perfect set of teeth. One only need watchThey Shall Not Grow Old (2018)to see how unrealistic this is. Indeed, the duo look like they've just stepped out of the makeup trailer most of the time, and it's glaring enough on a couple of occasions to pull you out of things.All things considered though, I thoroughly enjoyed 1917. I thought the single-shot strategy worked exceptionally well, and even if the film is weak from a character/storyline/theme perspective, it didn't really matter when the form and content are this well matched. This could have become an empty technical exercise predicated on nothing, but Mendes hasn't allowed that to happen. The Great War was hell on Earth. 1917 doesn't make us feel what that hell was like. Because no film, no art form, can do that. But it's a very fine approximation.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Sam Mendes' 1917 is, like DUNKIRK before it, a visually impressive but ultimately hollow viewing experience. I mean, I love tracking shots in cinema, but this is just one after another and the effective becomes diluted and underwhelming after a time. The film is at its best when the characters are picking their way through labyrinthine trenches in some stunning visual moments, and there are some CGI-aided set-pieces which are phenomenal too. A great film to look at, then, which brings to life the battlegrounds of WW1 in a way that few films can. A shame that there's virtually no story to go with the visuals. Mendes decided to do the writing himself, which was a mistake, and the characters are dull and paper-thin despite the actors trying their best. There's suspense in the first half, then a great twist, but this proves to be the highlight of the film as things go downhill afterwards. The nadir is the bit where the protagonist forgets his mission to coo at a baby for ten minutes. At this point it's just treading water until the end thankfully comes.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Generally the majority of the reviews of 1917 have been positive. But one of the chief arguments against the film among the negative reviews is that somehow director Sam Mendes has sanitized the war-it\\'s described as an \"empty spectacle\" or designed in effect as \"eye candy\" for \"thrill seekers.\"I can only push back against these views as Mendes\\'s \"spectacle\" is meant primarily to be entertaining. How can any film truly depict the horrors of war? By the very nature of cinematic art, there is going to be some distancing and in the case of a film about World War I, what better way to convey (in some measure) the utter pointlessness of that particular conflict then by creating an exciting story of two \"everyman\" soldiers, racing against time to prevent catastrophe?This whole idea that many of the soldiers\\' recollections (including Mendes\\'s own grandfather, on whom the film is loosely based) cannot be viewed simply in the context of their sense of adventure, is just plain wrong. As depicted in the film, a certain amount of suppression of feelings had to take place, just so the soldiers could carry on. Hence, 1917 is both a tale of adventure and cautionary tale about war.1917 also has been edited to suggest one continuous take, as though everything is happening in real time. Whether this is merely a gimmick, or adds to the overall verisimilitude, remains open to debate.The inciting incident occurs when a General orders Lance Corporal Blake to hand deliver a message to Blake\\'s brother\\'s battalion (miles away), to call off a planned attack on the Germans, who have actually reinforced their position, thus setting a trap for them. Before he finds out the nature of the mission, Blake selects the more cynical Schofield who ends up accompanying him into no-man\\'s land. All we know mainly about Schofield is that he traded a good bottle of wine for a medal he previously received-much to the chagrin of the more straight-laced Blake.So yes, Blake and Schofield aren\\'t very developed characters but they really don\\'t need to be. Mendes introduces their \"ordinary world\" as the trenches, where they exist most of the time, until being called to attack German positions. The two intrepid soldiers leave the ordinary world when they climb out of the trenches and make their way into no man\\'s land.There\\'s enough here at least to suggest some of the horrors of World War I including all the dead horses strewn about the bombed out landscape along with masses of rats and dead bodies-their faces eaten away by maggots. You can say that our protagonists are initially tested in the first half of the second act \"call to adventure,\" when they enter abandoned German trenches, which they must navigate through, in order to push forward toward their destination.Blake\\'s competence as a soldier is highlighted when he saves Schofield after a mouse hits a trip wire causing a tremendous explosion in the trenches which reach underground. It\\'s something unexpected and keeps us glued to the screen.The midpoint of the film comes early, in another extremely suspenseful scene-a German airplane is shot down and crashes a few feet from Blake and Schofield who have been making their way through an abandoned farmhouse.Schofield reaches the \"point of no return\" when the German pilot stabs Blake to death after they pull him out of a burning plane. It\\'s another shocking reversal and the mark of good creative screenwriting.The second half leading to the second act crisis is not as well thought out. Mendes has Schofield picked up by a passing British platoon and illustrates the difficulties of transportation during World War I (a truck gets stuck in the mud and must be extricated) along with an illustration on how soldiers must suppress their feelings in order to function (as the soldiers tell bawdy stories inside the truck, the camera focuses close-up on Schofield, who obviously is trying to contain his emotions, after experiencing the death of Blake, his friend and fellow soldier).Schofield\\'s dark moment, his second act crisis, involves direct combat with the Germans-first he must pick off a sniper and later, inside a bombed out French town, strangle a German soldier and escape another one, who fires at him incessantly with a rifle.In between, Schofield provides provisions to a French woman who is caring for an infant-it\\'s a scene designed to show Schofield\\'s humanity and make him more sympathetic. But what about all those shots fired at Schofield during this sequence?-yes he\\'s initially injured by a ricocheting bullet but later all the bullets fired at him, miss their mark!The improbable escape (which still features a neat, eerily lit town from flares and unattended fires), leads to another improbable (third act) escape, as Schofield must survive a wild trip down the cascading rapids of a river (this scene also proves to be not particularly original).1917 ends with an exciting climax as Schofield reaches the beleaguered battalion right before they advance on German positions. The way in which he must deliver the general\\'s orders to the company commander, Mackenzie, is riveting and equally poignant when he ends up informing Blake\\'s brother of the sad news of Blake\\'s death.Not everything in 1917 proves to be completely believable but this is a very solid film which manages to both entertain and (in small measure) convey the horrors of \"the war to end all wars.\"'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"April 1917, the Western Front. Two British soldiers are sent to deliver an urgent message to an isolated regiment. If the message is not received in time the regiment will walk into a trap and be massacred. To get to the regiment they will need to cross through enemy territory. Time is of the essence and the journey will be fraught with danger.I had highish hopes for this movie. Written and directed by Sam Mendes, who gave us such superb films as American Beauty, Revolutionary Road, Road to Perdition and Jarhead, and massively hyped this looked like it should be one of the best war films to come out for a while. Turns out, it's not.The plot is interesting enough but that's about it. 1917 doesn't go anywhere new, say anything profound or even provide a large amount of entertainment. It's an odyssey involving characters who are clumsily drawn and aren't particularly engaging, with some goodish action scenes that are few and far between. The military side is okay but not 100% plausible.If you were hoping that this might be a confronting drama, showing the wastefulness of war, there's elements of that but it has been done before and done better and more jarringly. It's only confronting and profound if you've never watched a realistic war movie before, and even then it's probably not graphic or engaging enough to make a profound point regarding war.Overall, it's okay, but not great, and quite disappointing.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Greetings again from the darkness. It\\'s now been over 100 years since World War I ended. The Great War garners barely a mention in high school history books these days, and Hollywood has devoted much more time and energy to WWII. Filmmaker Peter Jackson did his part with last year\\'s stunning documentary THEY SHALL NOT GROW OLD, a video and photographic look at the actual people involved in the First World War. And now, Oscar winning director Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY) delivers another glimpse ... and another technical marvel.Mr. Mendes, working with Oscar winning Cinematographer Roger Deakins (BLADE RUNNER 2049) and Oscar winning Film Editor Lee Smith (DUNKIRK), has shot and edited the film to give the look of one continuous take in real time. Although used previously in such films as Hitchcock\\'s ROPE and Inarritu\\'s BIRDMAN, the single take approach is certainly no gimmick here. We open on two young British soldiers lounging in a prairie as they are summoned to report to the commander. Their mission is described as critical, as a British battalion is preparing to walk into a deadly trap set by the Germans. More than 1600 lives are at stake and the phone lines are down. It\\'s up to Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield to work their way across No Man\\'s Land to the front line and hand-deliver an order stopping the attack. Oh, and one more detail: Blake\\'s older brother is in the battalion he is tasked with warning.The real time approach serves the purpose of allowing viewers to take on the urgency of Blake and Schofield. We experience the tension and horrors of war. Barbed wire, booby traps, slushy trenches, snipers, rats, dead bodies, dogfights (the aerial type) and towns under siege all play a part here as the men rush towards their goal of saving fellow soldiers lives, including a beloved family member. Dean-Charles Chapman (\"Game of Thrones\") plays Blake, and George MacKay (CAPTAIN FANTASTIC) plays Schofield. We spot the personality differences between them. Blake is super focused and determined to save his brother, while Schofield doesn\\'t welcome the assignment, but is a dutiful soldier and loyal friend.It\\'s really the Schofield character with whom the viewer mostly relates. He\\'s no super soldier or Jason Bourne-type, but rather a young man trying to stay alive and fulfill his orders. With the relentless pacing of the film, we feel the fear and admire the courage. There is an especially touching scene in a bombed-out town where paths are crossed with a French woman (Claire Duburcq) caring for an orphaned infant. It\\'s a reminder that humanity still exists, even within the bounds of war.There is no clock ticking in the corner of the screen, but we know time is of the essence, and quite limited. The camera seems to be always moving forward, rarely allowing for us or the characters to exhale. As you might expect, running is done frequently - sometimes towards something, sometimes from it. Roger Deakins is in prime form here with his camera, and there are too many remarkable moments to mention them all; however, the river rapids and waterfall, and the town under siege at night, are two of the most incredible sequences I\\'ve seen on screen.Along the journey, some familiar faces pop up as military men: Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Mark Strong, and Colin Firth. Although each appears only briefly, it\\'s a testament to their acting prowess that each is memorable. The chaos and relentless terror of war is on display, more often than not. But this isn\\'t a film designed to create deep thoughts or serious debates on the merits of war. Instead, it\\'s meant to focus on one of the countless personal stories that occur during war. War is fought by people, not faceless countries, and each person has their own story.Non-linear story telling has been a movie-thing since even before MEMENTO, but director Mendes (and co-writer Kristy Wilson-Cairns, \"Penny Dreadful\") show us the true presentation of linear ... in the moment and by the moment. GALLIPOLI and PATHS OF GLORY are about the closest comparisons I can come up with, and the weight of the film is felt physically and emotionally as we are drawn in. The exceptional score from Thomas Newman (14 time Oscar nominee) serves to accentuate the chaos and relentless terror. It\\'s a work of art and a unique viewing experience.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is the latest Oscar bait war movie to come out, though this time set in World War 1. Most of these films like to be set in World War 2 or Vietnam, or even Iraq. The only other film in recent memory set in WWI is Wonder Woman, which barely counts as a war movie. I'm personally not the biggest fan of war movies. They can get boring, and many of them tend to feel the same. The last war movie I saw in theaters was Dunkirk, which everyone adored except me. I thought movie was a boring slog. There are some war films I really like though, such as Apocalypse Now and We Are Soldiers. The ones I enjoy the most tend to be ones like Wonder Woman and Overlord where the war is just the backdrop. It isn't the main story. Apocalypse Now could fall into that category as well.Is this movie good? Yes. As war movies go this one is definitely solid, if not above average. The performances were good. The cinematography is amazing. The score, coupled with the set pieces, give the film a very eerie and tension-filled atmosphere.The thing that stands out the most about this film is the way it's shot. This film is made to seem like it was filmed in one take, or at least two takes, even though that's not the case. I don't know how they did it, but they truly made it look like they shot the entire film all in one go. I don't think I've seen another movie shot like this. This sets 1917 apart not just from other war movies, but other films in general. Because of this it truly feels like you're taking this journey along with our lead characters, and it almost never gives you time to breathe.If you're looking for lots of action, which is typical for a film like this, you're not going to get much of it. While it has its action, this is much more of a thriller than an action piece. I find it funny that a movie like Dunkirk had much more action in it, yet I was more engaged by this movie than that one. This probably because you're with the characters much more in this film and you get to see them constantly struggle against overwhelming odds all alone. Dunkirk was much more focused on its massive action that the characters got lost in all of it.There's not much characterization here either. However, because we're with these characters for literally the entire film I was able connect with them and their plights much more. The performances by the lead actors helped as well. I felt the acting was pretty flat all around in Dunkirk.Overall, if you like war movies then this is definitely a must see. If you just want to see a good thriller then this is worth checking out as well.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Movie was stunningly beautiful to watch and the effects and cinematography....blah blah blah were all amazing.Where i have trouble with it is the plot and the events that followed. Only 2 people are tasked to go on a mission of great importance and there was supposed to be no enemy in the way but it was more of an assumption. Seriously my commanding officer would have sent minimum 8, just in case. While the camera work and cinematography and sound effects were amazing, in terms of actual dread and despair there isn't much. As visually stunning as the movie is, filming a war that was known to be one of the worst in history... the plot, dialogue, and overall feel of the film felt campy. Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Lebanon, Fury, Das Boot were all far more engaging and far more suspenseful.Visuals, the long camera sequences and achievements done behind the camera is the only reason this movie gets a 5 out of 10. Considering all the WWI material i have read, and seen in movies or documentaries, and comparing it to other war movies this doesn't crack my top 15 war movies list.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I finally found a war film that I absolutely love. 1917 is the latest effort from a very quality filmmaker in Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes has never made a film that I didn't like and so seeing a new war film from him was something I was going to welcome with open arms. This film from opening frame is an absolute technical and emotional journey. Its worth a watch in the cinemas while you can and something I am looking to go see again when I can.The film is about the journey of two British soldiers who are tasked with delivering an important message about an impending German ambush on British forces during Operation Alberich. The soldiers go on a long and dangerous journey in order to stop this massive planned attack. The film stars George McKay, Dean Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch. It is Sam Mendes' first non Bond film since 2009.The obvious must be stated first. I am a huge fan of long takes. Loved Alfred Hitchcock's Rope which was a pioneer in that technique. Then we had memorable long takes through the years including one of my favorites for Gravity. This entire film is presented as one long take; a riveting continuous shot. It is absolutely incredible and completely contributes to the claustrophobic, frantic, and ever present war setting. Roger Deakins is a legend and needs another Academy Award for his work here. Simply incredible. Everything about the set was realistic. The bodies, dirt, and filth looked so authentic. For two hours you feel like you are in the trenches and in the war field, hearing every shot fired and every roaring plane overhead.Technically the film is a brilliant achievement. It also composes of an excellent score, one that complements each changing scene in the film. So much went into how the film looks and I love that critics have been appreciating it. I had no problems with the fleeting characters and think the two initial leads and their bond is captured well enough. We are here for the journey which is ever changing and sporadic. Overall, this was an extremely pleasant way to end the year for me. One of the years very best.8.5/10\"},\n",

I gave a highly detailed review, with nothing offensive, that was never allowed on the page. I have no idea why. This is quite annoying, when you have an entire critique wasted and your time wasted-- for absolutely no reason.Anyway, I was very excited to watch this WW1 movie, but hailing it as the next Saving Private Ryan is just stupid. The movie and cinematography are very amazing, but that is it...that is truly all that goes on in this film. It is like watching cut scenes or playing a video game. Hell, even a game has more action and exciting scenes. I cannot believe they wasted all this time with hardly any real trench experiences or massive battles, etc. They didn't develop characters, and there are terrible moments where the guys should kill a German, but just run past him, so he can alert the others. WTF??? In one scene, the hero has a German chasing him, firing at him. The German falls down a few feet behind him, but seems to still be pursuing him. The hero simply rounds a corner and walks into a house with a girl and her baby, calmly spending a few hours chilling with her, as if nothing happened. What happened to the guys chasing him??? Then he jumps in a river and floats a mile or so from the enemies and walks up on a bunch of Brits just sitting around with their backs turned, listening to a singer. No sentries on guard or anything. The behavior of the unit he goes to warn is stupid as well, and nothing else pivotal ever happens. This movie is WAY overrated, and could have been a true masterpiece but is more of a 1-6 rating, rather than 8. Make a better story next time...\"},\n",

It's thrilling, exciting, scary, shocking and heartfelt, all jam-packed into one beautiful film.The biggest topic of this film is probably how it looked as if it was shot in one single, continuous take. And there's good reason for it. The one-take format just elevated this whole movie with so much more tension and immersiveness. It's very well done from Sam Mendes. There are some scenes where it's easy to spot when they decided to stop the shot and transition into another, but over time it just became seamless.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is also very on-point (as usual). As well as Thomas Newman's score. That was 1917's secret weapon. The score brings the movie from 100 to 1000. Everything is just elevated the moment Newman's score hits and it is beautiful.Performance wise, the entire cast is superb. Especially George MacKay. His performance was just fantastic. I did appreciate that the film didn't focus on the characters with the big stars (Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden) playing them.1917 is an epic, visceral, stunning depiction of WWI.

Unfortunately, I can't say I agree with the academy on it being a best picture contender. That being said, this is some of the most brilliant cinematography I have ever seen in my life. For the uninitiated, the film is shot in such a way that it seems like it is all done in 1 or 2 scenes. I know some big name films have done this before, but this is my first experience with the style. When you combo that 1 take with the brilliant picture and color that 1917 provides, you end up with a stylish and enthralling story that would have otherwise felt lackluster. Definitely worth a watch and a cinematography Oscar.\"},\n",

Of course, this film essentially expresses \"anti-war\" . This 1917 tells everyone that war is terrible through the stench of two soldiers, the French women and newborn babies who are lingering in the basement.The film tells everyone that war is terrible and peace is important.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'There was a lot of hype behind this film before I got a chance to see it myself, reading review after review...........giving extremely high praise and being tipped to win Best Picture at this year\\'s Oscar\\'s!!!!! It had a lot to live up too............I am please to say that for the most part, yes this film is truly incredible.....however I ended up not liking it as much as I thought I would !!There is three people behind the camera I want to congratulate first on this epic achievement. Firstly, no surprise, Sam Mendes..........to even think the idea of shooting the film pretty much one take or so it looks like it was done in one take, is extremely ballsy. Granted he isn\\'t the first or the last filmmaker to use this technique on film, however nobody has come close to this scale as of yet.......especially in a war film. Right from the get go the film starts and it doesn\\'t stop at all really until the end, the run time flies by...........this is helped by the \"one shot\" use. Simple but an interesting, emotionally driven story that keeps you riveted all the way along........you as the audience are taking each corner or scene with the characters. The amount of detail that has gone into this film is incredible, especially after watching some of the behind the scenes...........wow, a truly wonderful achievement, one of Mendes\\'s best. The other two people behind the camera who deserve a mention are Roger Deakins and Thomas Newman respectively. The combination of their cinematography and score at times really really does leave you speechless............both of them absolutely top class !George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are both great in the film, its definitely helped by the fact that they are relatively unknown actors, which can only help in the audience immersion and believability of their characters. You simply believe them and their rationale for everything they do and say..........they are young men being put in an almost impossible position, I cant quiet fathom how terrifying that sort thing must have been............if this story were real !There some great little cameos to from some extremely recognisable faces. Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch all have small roles but are extremely effective. The film needed someone who was more experienced.......a leader and all of them were great on screen for their limited time. Good work!However after all of that I\\'m left in a really strange place...........I really really liked the film it is very good don\\'t get me wrong, its just maybe I was expecting something that much better considering the hype?!?!?! I don\\'t know what it is about the film there is just something.......not lacking but something that little bit extra special.....I cant put it into words or describe it.....its just a feeling!! Put it this way if you gave me the choice of watching \"1917\" or \"Dunkirk\" or \"Hacksaw Ridge\" I wouldn\\'t choose \"1917\".........Its just not very re-watchable!?!??!Overall though with that little minor gripe out the way I still really really enjoyed the film it is very good 80% out of 100.........not my favourite of the year, actually nowhere near being the best of year for me........but thats my personal opinion!! Great directing, acting, production design, cinematography and score...........just not very re-watchable for me unfortunately!! But definitely should go and see in the theatre !!!!'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I was excited about this upcoming war movie for the various trailers and behind-the-clips shown about two months before its release, then it was getting a lot of attention during Awards Season, so I made sure to see it on a big IMAX screen, from BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Sir Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Skyfall). Basically, during the First World War in April 1917, the German army has pulled back from a sector of the Western Front in the north of France. General Erinmore (Colin Firth) briefs two young British soldiers Lance Corporal, Blake (Game of Thrones\\' Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (Sunshine on Leith\\'s George MacKay). Aerial reconnaissance has confirmed that the Germans are not retreating but have made a tactical withdrawal to their new Hindenburg Line, where they are waiting to overwhelm the attacking British with artillery. With field telephone lines cut, Blake and Schofield are ordered to hand-deliver a message to the Second Battalion of the Devonshire Regiment, calling off their planned attack, which might cost the lives of 1,600 men including Blake\\'s brother Joseph (Bodyguard\\'s Richard Madden). Schofield and Blake cross no man\\'s land and reach the abandoned German trenches. These turn out to contain tripwires, and a rat triggers a planted bomb. The ensuing explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake manages to dig him out. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where they witness a dogfight (an aerial battle). The German plane plunges into the farm and Schofield and Blake save the pilot from burning. Schofield proposes to mercy kill him, having severe injuries, but Blake has Schofield fetch water for the pilot. The pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield, who comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission. Schofield is picked up by a passing British unit, led by Captain Smith (Mark Strong). A destroyed bridge near the bombed-out village, Écoust-Saint-Mein, prevents lorries from crossing. So, Schofield crosses the remnants of the bridge alone. A German sniper across the river in an abandoned house tries to attack him. Schofield tracks down and kills the sniper, only to be knocked out by a ricocheting bullet. It is night when Schofield regains consciousness. He walks through the nearby ruins, when he is spotted by and fired at by a German soldier. Schofield stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with a baby. She treats his wounds, and he gives her his canned food and his canteen filled with milk from the farm. Schofield leaves and is again spotted by two German soldiers. He strangles one and pushes the one that is too inebriated to stop him. Other soldiers chase him, but he escapes by jumping into a river. Schofield reaches the Battalion as the British attack is due to begin. He fails to stop the start of the attack, so he sprints across the battlefield, after realising that the trenches are too full of soldiers for him to make it to the commander in time. He forces his way into meeting Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) and shows the letter, and the attack is called off. Schofield then locates Joseph, who was among the first attacking wave but is unhurt, and delivers the news of Blake\\'s death. Joseph is upset but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to Blake\\'s mother to tell her about Blake\\'s heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Schofield walks away and rests under a nearby tree. It ends with Schofield looking at photos of his loved ones, his two young daughters and a wife at home. Also starring Spectre\\'s Andrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie, Plus One\\'s Daniel Mays as Sergeant Sanders, Killing Eve\\'s Adrian Scarborough as Major Hepburn, Richard McCabe as Colonel Collins and Billy Postlethwaite, Pete\\'s son as NCO Harvey. The cast are all impressive, the locations, costumes and period detail are authentic and fantastic, but it is the direction by Mendes, camerawork and choreography that deserves the most praise. Movies like Rope, Silent House, and Birdman have used the \"one shot\" technique, filming continuously for long periods, and making near-unnoticeable edits, apart from the obvious fade to black, it is almost impossible to spot the edits, it really plunges the viewer into brutality and horror of the war, a moving, effective and and breathlessly immersive epic war drama. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Screenplay for Sam Mendes and Krysty Wilson-Cairns, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design, Best Original Score for Thomas Newman, and Best Sound Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Original Music, and Best Make Up/Hair, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated Best Original Score.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I hate the word \\'gimmick\\' as it relates to filmmaking. Gimmick is an unconstructive word, something that can be tossed off to cheapen actual visions. 1917 is no \"gimmick movie\". It\\'s an experimental grand slam that takes a chance on a unique visual structure and successfully moves cinema into new directions. The conversation around Sam Mendes\\' World War One drama has inevitably revolved around its audacious, single-shot framework. That technical feat is worth discussing. But so is the film itself and the way Sam Mendes weaves both camera and story together into a brilliant tapestry of beauty in the most hellish war ever fought.The bones of 1917 are familiar to those who have seen their share of war movies. It\\'s World War One and there is a mission that has to be carried out. The British Army are preparing for an all out charge against the Germans. Little do they know, they are running into a trap. With communications down, two young soldiers, played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, are dispatched into enemy lines to deliver the message to stand down. This type of story is not new territory for war movies. Saving Private Ryan chronicled a very similar mission, and Dunkirk involved similar themes of the affecting nature of battle. In the hands of a less capable, less creative director, 1917 might not do enough to separate itself from those towering films. That\\'s where 1917\\'s visual style comes into play. The movie is designed to look like one, continuous tracking shot. A gamble to be sure, but one that pays off.Cinematographer Roger Deakin\\'s camera is 1917\\'s ace in the hand. It moves fluidly through each set piece, keeping the action clear, informing key moments, and only drawing attention to itself when it should, in the grand emotional climaxes that litter the trek. That said, there are certain things you can\\'t do as well with the one-take approach. It\\'s harder to get those iconic, stand out images when the camera is so often in the same position; following the protagonists from behind or back tracking in front of them. Mendes can\\'t as easily put the camera in interesting positions or angles when the characters have to be in frame 99% of the time. But what that apparent disadvantage does, is make the few memorable images there are, such as a cherry blossom \"snowfall\" or a ruined town lit completely by flare light, more special because they seem to spring organically from the world. We don\\'t have the expectation that we\\'re going to see art, so when it\\'s there, it stuns.The real advantage of the camera is in how it intensifies the pressure of the mission. Being so intimate with the characters makes the explosive beats shockingly effective. I jumped out of my seat on more than one occasion. Also, the movie takes place in real time, making the major point of tension, the countdown to the dawn attack, all the more impactful. Here, the passage of time isn\\'t imagined through age old editing tricks, it\\'s really there. From the first five minutes, we get a refreshing sense that this movie is going to provide feelings unlike any other war film. You\\'re locked into the mission immediately. The clock starts ticking and the movie never lets you out of its grip until the very end.The reason this novel experimentation never wears thin is because underneath the visceral excitement it creates is a major emotional ride. Chapman and MacKay are a solid step above the average young British actor, exhibiting welcome restraint in moments that could slide into melodrama. Thomas Newman\\'s rousing score does most of the heavy lifting in that department, but the balance never tips to schmaltz. That is due to an authenticity rivaling Saving Private Ryan, the best ever cinematic approximation of war. The ubiquitous little physical details in the trenches and on the battlegrounds seem to inspire the actors. No one player feels out of place. There is an overwhelming sensation that this is what The Great War was like. The relative attention to realism, combined with thunderous sound design and real time tension, make for incredible immersion.To discuss this movie based on its cinematography alone, ignores how stunning the rest of the movie is, and the way every element works together. Forget the \"gimmick\" talk. 1917 is simply a brilliant, harrowing war film. The most unforgettable image, MacKay\\'s character sprinting through the battlefield, with mortars exploding around him and hundreds of soldiers charging forward into certain death, is momentous not because of what the camera is doing, but because we were there with him in every moment leading up to it, and we feel its significance in the story. See 1917 for its exhilaration, its horror, and its beauty. There\\'s no other film quite like it.92/100'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningApril, 1917. World War One is drawing to a close, but the odds are no less tense. In the trenches, on the Western Front, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are stationed, serving in their unit. Blake finds himself summoned to General Erinmore (Colin Firth) who asks him to choose someone to accompany him on a mission to stop another unit, which includes his brother, from launching an attack, which will benefit the Germans. Selecting Schofield for a seemingly easy mission, the pair find themselves thrust into a terrifying battle for survival.Here, as we are, in the early part of the twenty first century, living in turbulent and unpredictable times, where no one can be certain what will happen or what's around the corner, many of us will carry on our lives, sparing nowhere near as much thought as we should for the terrible sacrifices and hardships that were suffered for us to have the life we have today. And so, renowned director Sam Mendes transports us back over a century, when these events were in full swing, and sweeps us up right in the heart of the horrors of the battlefield, with a unique and trailblazing style that absorbs you in ways you can't imagine.So, yes, more on that ground breaking style. Mendes shoots his feature in one long, continuous take for the duration of the feature, keeping us in the heart of the travails of our lead protagonists, and their inner conflicts, struggles and demons as they embark on their dangerous and uncertain mission. They amble on, stomaching the horrors of the battlefield with as much humour and resilience as they can, their relative calm punctuated by the sudden, cruel loud blast of a mortar shell or elaborately hidden enemy device. Newcomers (or, at least, relative newcomers) Chapman and MacKay in the leads deliver their roles with conviction and power, with solid support from established older co stars such as Firth and Daniel Mays.An accomplished, seasoned (and still fairly young) director applies his talent and professionalism and has delivered one of the most surprising, absorbing and breath taking films of modern times, as well as a brilliant testament to the horrors suffered to give us our freedom. With any justice, it'll sweep the Oscars. *****\"},\n",

Feels like a missed opportunity, a very interesting experiment that just does not quite work.Most of the movie felt like a series of Call Of Duty cut scenes, a video game you had no control over, a really odd feeling, and some of the scenes were like a video game in content with reality stretched to almost breaking point.To me it was an adventure movie rather than a 'war movie', much more like Indiana Jones than Saving Private Ryan... To relate it to another movie I felt it reminded me very much of The Revenant in story and style, but like that movie it felt rather empty to me.\"},\n",

As it seems very few Directors are willing to take on the mud and the blood to produce an original story. However this is a great peice of UK film making, shot on locations such as Salisbury Plain and Scotland. With a stela cast of British actors who are not over stated or underused. The main story is about two characters we are shown this from the start. It's a journey, even a race against the clock. It's tense and slow-burning simmering away. It manages to avoid being predictable and shows the war from our young tommies point of veiw. Its a fresh take on a movie where by the feel of it being shot in one take helps improve the story. This is the best British film about World War One and to me atleast, the best British film released in awhile.\"},\n",

I'm positive they watched a different movie because this movie is a great achievement and the greatest war movie since Saving Private Ryan.I've read a few reviews that say the one shot style is a gimmick and I 100% disagree. The one shot style draws you into the story like nothing else. You are there the whole time with these 2 men in one of the worst times in history. The level of tension you feel the whole time wondering if a sniper is going to take them out or they get shot by a random German at any time is why it works.You feel the emotion as they do, the tragedy, the sorrow and everything else that happened along the way. Personally, a movie is a great movie if it can move you emotionally. This movie moved me many many times.Once the movie finished, we all just sat there in silence while we thought over what we had just seen. I know war is hell and I know WWI was way worse than what we saw. But that doesn't take anything away from the masterpiece that is 1917.Thank you to all who made this and to the great men that fought and sacrificed their lives for our freedom.\"},\n",

The cinematography is outstanding, the films matter is delicately and respectfully handled, the lesser known actors are shining lights among the much bigger stars who pop up occasionally.This is a story of two soldiers trying to reach the front lines during World War I in an attempt to stop a doomed advance into enemy fire and save as many men as they can.It has all the horror and shocks you'd expect if you knew but a small amount about trench warfare, it is visually stunning and the story is gripping as well as occasionally being soul-destroying.I personally felt the film was probably about 20 minutes too long, one of many sequences could've been sacrificed and the film wouldn't have lost anything but would've gained a bit of pace.Dean Charlies-Chapman and especially George MacKay are superb and it would be a travesty of their careers didn't flourish because of this. Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong to name a few powerhouses pop up for just enough time to move the story along and not take away from what is happening.A 1917/20 from me, I feel disrespectful giving it a grade due to its subject matter.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This fine film\\'s title made me think immediately of the Third Battle of Ypres, better known as Passchendaele. That, however, was fought between 31 July and 6 November 1917, whereas the film is set on 6 April. 1917 draws upon the memories of the director Sir Sam Mendes\\'s grandfather and was designed, remarkably, to look like one continuous shot.The two central characters, Lance-Corporals Tom Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Will Schofield (George McKay), go on a desperate mission. This lasts one day, and certainly feels like it, and they\\'re exposed to the full horror of World War 1. There\\'s also a devastating tragedy along the way.Together with the horror, I think, there\\'s pathos. I was reminded of the words of the great WW1 poet Wilfred Owen, \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\" This is partly reflected in the film\\'s central theme of devotion to duty, based on absolute obedience to orders - even when a high-ranking officer tells Will to \"f off\" (I\\'d say that\\'s one of the most shocking moments in the film).There\\'s some underlying pathos too in the camaraderie between most of the young soldiers. Of course we know now that the great majority had to make the ultimate sacrifice, so the pathos is self-evident. They couldn\\'t have known that, though, and we see that they\\'re generally innocently good-natured and quick to help their comrades. Tom and Will clash at times but essentially they have a strong bond of friendship.Pity and horror are combined when soldiers are shot dead on sight simply for being identified as \"the enemy\". Some words from Wilfred Owen\\'s poem \"Strange Meeting\" come to mind: \"I am the enemy you killed, my friend. /I knew you in this dark: for so you frowned/Yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed.\" This is even more poignant as Owen himself was killed one week before the Armistice.This film is deeply impressive and has, I think, no major faults. There are just some \"arty\" effects of flashing colours and some insistent background music. It also has touches of an action movie in which heroism triumphs against the most overwhelming odds. This is redeemed by the desperate seriousness of the mission at the heart of the film.It was clever to give cameo roles to a few star actors, including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard Madden. Nicholas Hytner had already done the same in \"The Lady in the Van\", redeploying stars from the stage and screen versions of \"The History Boys\".'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'So I decided to see this on my 22nd birthday - as I\\'d been wanting to watch it ever since I\\'d viewed the first trailer upon its release - & what a gift 1917 turned out to be!Intense, thrilling, enthralling, emotional, captivating; a remarkable technical achievement - insanely complex with its inventive ingenuity & yet made to looks so easy & simplistic as a stunningly immersive cinematic experience.Not a single ounce of the awe or admiration I had for the sheer craft of this film detracted from the story as the audience & I witnessed it unfold.Regardless of the outstanding level of meticulous consideration made for each & every frame of the movie\\'s genius visual progression, we were all absolutely encapsulated, glued to our seats & eventually left the theatre as one collective mass of blubbering messes.Roger Deakins continuously surprises; I naively presumed Blade Runner 2049 would be defined as his career best & in decades to come, we\\'d look back & label it as the point in which his work eventually \"peaked\"... But then within just 2 films & 2 years later, he returns to obliterate his previous accomplishments, blowing what we thought we knew of his capabilities right out of the water, exceeding expectations immediately.Not only that but more importantly, Sam Mendes manages to expertly capture the unending horrors of war - depicting its grim brutality & inhumanity whilst also providing contrasting glimpses of it in the serenely quieter, contemplative moments, whilst conveying the general desperation for peace - reminding us that those who fought were not two dimensional military caricatures but normal men thrust in to an abnormal & hopeless situation - one they were never accustomed to or ever fully prepared for. Their battles weren\\'t valiant or heroic - the conflicts erupted from the struggles of survival. Additionally, the violence isn\\'t glorified or portrayed as inherently good, but morbidly necessary in the intent of preserving life. It\\'s this moral ambiguity which prevents the feature from becoming clichéd.The astonishing production design, the strikingly intelligent & concise writing, the breathtaking cinematography, the faultless direction, the subtly masterful editing & the incredible music (major praise given to Thomas Newman for crafting such a fierce & tense score); all of this culminated to form what can only be described as a genuine masterpiece.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"If you're ever in the mood to watch a war film, there's an over-abundance of them throughout history. You can almost always find one that you haven't seen before. For this reason alone, I find myself being very cautious when one is about to get a wide release. With recent releases like Hacksaw Ridge or Dunkirk, my faith in the genre is always rejuvenated. Well, 1917 is yet another war film to come along and surprise me. For all the technical reasons to love this film on top of the powerful story itself, here's why I believe 1917 is one of 2019s very best films.The premise is nice and simple. Two young soldiers are given the task of sneaking through enemy lines in order to deliver a message to their commander, which will, in turn, save thousands of lives if received in time. This premise makes for a very tense ride. On top of being an engaging story, this movie is filmed in such a way that it makes it feel like one continuous take, for the most part, which ultimately begs the core actors to deliver the performances of their career.Although I've seen him in great films like Captain Fantastic and Pride, George MacKay never really stood out to me as award-worthy, but I stand corrected. This may very well be the best performance he ever gives, but that's not a negative, because I'll always remember him for this role. Alongside him is Dean-Charles Chapman, who I've also liked in Game of Thrones and Blinded by the Light, so I knew to expect a solid performance from him. With that said, he also delivers one of the better performances I've seen in 2019, simply due to the devotion he has to his character.Now, this would absolutely be an incomplete review if I forgot to bring up how incredible the technical aspects of this film are. Roger Deakins is basically a god in the cinematography world, so his work astounds me every single time he brings his vision to a project, and 1917 is no exception to that. The way this camera seamlessly follows these actors in and out of small or big sequences was simply astonishing. Layered on top of this jaw-dropping cinematography is the superb score by Thomas Newman. The combination of being swept up in these performances, caring about the story, being impressed by the camerawork, and then finally being moved by how well the music was composed for each scene, I found it very difficult to criticize anything here.Overall, 1917 deserves a standing ovation for the technical aspects, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact that this movie also wouldn't have been as good as it is without the careful direction by Sam Mendes. Between his work on American Beauty or Skyfall, it should come as no surprise that he would make a great film, but the crew around him took it to another level in my opinion. I was sucked in from start to finish and the two-hour run time flew by. I can't recommend this film enough. Easily one of my favourite films of 2019.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Please dismiss anyone who criticizes 1917 harshly as overanalytical snobs, perhaps haters of blockbuster films, and assume that they secretly liked it, because really, how can one not. Sure, you can find fault with it; if I had directed 1917 I would have done a few things differently. Still, you just can\\'t argue that it\\'s not a masterfully-crafted film that is riveting pretty much every moment from start to finish.First, to anyone who might hesitate to go see the film because they think they will be subjected to the graphic violence and gore of, say, Saving Private Ryan, then don\\'t hesitate anymore, and go see it. While 1917 is realistically gruesome, director Sam Mendes depicts the horrors of war - weird choice of words coming up, I know - beautifully. By that I mean, even the most horrifying and sad shots in the film, while highly stimulating in the aesthetic and emotional sense, are never extremely graphic, and you are never hit over the head with it. 1917, in this way, is a beautiful artistic masterpiece, never straying close to being shock art, but not holding back at the same time.What would I have done differently had I directed the film? I would have toned down the \"bad guys can\\'t shoot very well\" cliché. I know, it\\'s dark much of the time, the hero is running and zigzagging through built-up areas which offer a lot of protection to an elusive target, and I don\\'t mean to imply that our hero does not elude death at times because he makes some sound lightening-fast decisions; it\\'s just that, at other times, that cliché seems to rear its ugly head. Another implausibility in the film is, our hero spends probably a good ten minutes going for an unplanned, unintentional swim in the river, yet nothing seems to have gotten wet afterwards. Seriously nitpicking now for implausibilities, but as food in the trenches of World War 1 was scarce, and rations were measly, why then cast a chubby actor as one of the protagonists. There\\'s a scene where he\\'s grateful to be given a small crust of bread, and it\\'s somewhat incongruous considering he looks so well-fed.What else? I\\'m not a fan of soundtracks that are seemingly intended to push the please-feel-something-now buttons, and 1917 has a button-pushing soundtrack. But at least the music is apropos, not sappy in any way. In general, I don\\'t like the idea of war having a soundtrack, because soundtracks invariably glorify war.I\\'ll be interested to read reviews from people who have had first-hand battlefield experience; I have not, so I don\\'t necessarily consider above to be a credible critique. It\\'s just how I personally experienced the film.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '...Much more than Dunkirk, 1917 feels like a compliment to Saving Private Ryan, and, if you\\'ll pardon the obvious connection, a brother film to it. While Spielberg houses Saving Private Ryan in a groundbreaking, bombastic and terrifying shell to shock a reminder to the world of the sacrifices made in recent history to afford us our freedom and complacency, 1917 is a love letter to those who never gave up, and enlisted a purity of spirit to see their missions to their end. And like Saving Private Ryan, Sam Mendes does this with no less bravura and potency.In many ways, despite the comparisons, 1917 is the antithesis of Dunkirk, a film that is more of an exercise than a cinematic experience, one that strains the limits of its medium in a different way, a finely tuned watch turned out and rearranged in front of you, and with a sadistic and pervading intent to accost and unbalance you immediately and not let go until the final moments.1917, however, goes out of its way to show you the linearity and simplicity of its thrust; the trenches, such as they were designed to be, are the perfect proof of concept to get the audience on board and lulled to this new version of cinema presentation with the long takes. The film takes the time to show you the world through environmental storytelling (not the first time in this review I\\'ll reference video games!) and whereas Gravity put its bland characters and dialogue front and centre, 1917 carefully uses the extra characters and dialogue as a subconscious layer or normality, to draw you in to a hypnotic trance as Deakins\\' camerawork and lighting slowly pulls out of the faces of the leads their grief or exhaustion, wracked with unimaginable thoughts we are blessed never to have to think.And as such, and due to its vibrant camera work and unstuffy photography, it doesn\\'t feel twee or old at all. The approach of ensuring 1917 didn\\'t feel rote or samey and instead feel exceptionally present and modern and human also allows it to be relatable and less of an archive document and more resonant to now.Many of Deakins\\' shots are incredible. In fact almost all of them are, not content with stitching multiple long takes together, Mendes/Deakins et al have crafted a million moving paintings. And the long takes are a thing of beauty; a few conveniently placed rocks or cuts to black in the cloth of someone\\'s back notwithstanding, this is the absolute best I\\'ve seen this kind of technology and approach being used. It\\'s a far cry from the awkward shoehorning of some of Birdman\\'s obvious cuts and even pips Cuaron\\'s Children of Men for most impactful use of long takes.This is most felt in moments of real loss. The camera, lingering there as we know it will, injected into me a deep sadness at the normality of death, the general lack of significance or theatricality. The acting then benefits greatly from these long takes, the characters feeling like they are ebbing and flowing physically and emotionally towards and away from us as if we\\'re running to keep up with a busy friend, afraid we\\'ll lose them. As they draw away they seem to emotionally retreat into themselves, and when we\\'re gifted a close up, it\\'s such a palpable and tacit moment that it eclipses theatre (the medium compared to 1917 most in early interviews) by proving us with the heartbreaking simplicity of looking into another\\'s face. Mark Strong acts up a treat in the small part he\\'s in and he\\'s an enigmatic and welcome role and one that proves he can still act beyond generic villains with unconvincing American accents.1917 owes a great debt to video games; the walking simulator, the first person shooter and the stealth game. Certain moments feeling like they are ripped directly from video games; the tense barren walk listening for gunfire or footsteps, twitch finger on the trigger ready for when that enemy rounds the corner in Call of Duty, will you shoot or flee? Or those moments of respite and story in Metro, between the gunfire and struggle, as you wander through an enclave of survivors, or silently taking down an enemy as you spin the camera around to see if his mate can see you in his cone of vision. All these moments are fresh and immediate in a way that\\'s missing from something like Dunkirk. However, I don\\'t think that\\'s the only reason for this, I think that using much more of a recognised first person perspective approach mirrors the diaries and letters and journals chronicling World War I and so 1917 manages to be authentic my borrowing from a very modern medium and arches backwards by reaching forwards.I\\'m intrigued why, besides in order to advance the timeline, that Mendes chose to put that single obvious cut in the film. And I\\'m not sure I liked or needed the subtitles, it pulled me right out of the experience and reminded me I was watching a film and it served little purpose, especially because the French was designed to be simple and he didn\\'t really understand it anyway. I\\'m reminded of Polanski and his one regret with Chinatown when he wished he\\'d put the image on a camera lens upside down as it would have been in real life but for studio pressure he relented and put it the incorrect way for clarity. I wonder if Mendes would look back on this the same way.But that notwithstanding the film is close to flawless. And despite being half an hour longer than Dunkirk, it doesn\\'t feel it and I wouldn\\'t have taken anything out. Interestingly it must have been tight and bold screenplay to allow for almost no wiggle room and little retiming. I guess that\\'s Mendes\\' theatre experience kicking in. The film is full of little moments but they are the most meaningful parts. In some slim ways I thought Tarkovsky may be proud of it, and I had partial and welcome Stalker and Andrei Rublev flashbacks.The film is essentially about you and this soldier. And how much you really connect with him is a testament to how earned and fist-pumping the more (brief) saccharine moments are. There\\'s a close up towards the end of the film and I felt as if I could read the characters mind and I was completely urging him to make the decision I knew he would make anyway. That\\'s powerful stuff and a feeling I never really get in cinema very much anymore.Those moments are swept up, bolstered, underscored or otherwise lifted by Thomas Newman\\'s incredible score. Newman, not a stranger to iconic, recognisable and listen-to-able scores manages to do the impossible (for him) and creates a powerful score that doesn\\'t immediately sound like his work. It\\'s a score that tells all that\\'s missing in a scene without the film having to resort to exposition. It\\'s not an an obvious score until it wants to be. And it\\'s a world away from Zimmer\\'s now predictable cacophony even though it sometimes scantily resembles it in places.There was a moment in the film, a very deliberate moment of drama and arch-power when I realised what an aural and visual treat this movie was. It was like being on the stage of an opera; it was grandiose and energetic and flamboyant and iconic and at the centre was this small figure running through what for many could have been their afterlife. This \"afterlife\" moment felt like adrenaline itself; not shock, just awe; danger, fragility, beauty and purity. I have never wanted a moment in a movie, without realising it, more. It was cinematic bliss. Good job 1917. My day started and I was at work. But by the end of it, I was exactly where I wanted to be.'},\n",

Everything in the picture is designed to make you an intimate witness: the writing, the performances, the cinematography, the editing (or lack thereof), the uniqueness of all the exteriors which never repeat, and it is incredibly effective. You find yourself holding your breath as the action plays out. The seed of this film came from the stories Sam Mendes heard his grandfather tell of his time as a message courier in the First World War. The partnership between Mendes and cinematographer, Roger Deakins, to create the movie as one long shot is award worthy and completely elevates the film above its genre. It's not just a war movie, or an action movie, or a thriller, or a drama. It's all of this things, and more. A truly intimate experience, I give this film a rating of 9 (superb) out of 10.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I just came back from seeing \\'1917\\', and it\\'s a tense, absorbing, grim, and yet inspiring 2-hour journey. The theater was packed, and you could sense that every single person in the audience was mentally and emotionally glued to the screen. It\\'s a fictional story, but built from real elements that director Sam Mendes heard from his grandfather, who acted as a messenger during WWI in just the same way as shown in the film. The WWI setting and the basic storyline sound familiar enough, but it\\'s all in how the pieces are put together, and having seen it I now know why it\\'s a Best Movie of the Year contender.A bit more than halfway through the movie there is an absolutely riveting centerpiece: a few British and German soldiers are trying to get through a ruined French town at night without being spotted and killed by the other side. Half-fallen buildings and corridors of stone arches are illuminated by flickering light from bombs and flares that come and go while they hide and run. It\\'s as if we\\'ve stepped into an eerie, lurid half-world from a fever dream. I\\'ve never seen anything like this before, and words don\\'t do do it justice -- just go and see it. This scene when added to several others feel like a tour through the circles of Hell (as in, Dante). That sequence is almost equalled toward the end when, the next morning, the battalion goes \\'over the top\\' from the trenches while one of the messengers, Will (played by young George MacKay) runs desperately down the line across them to deliver the crucial letter (a small part of that scene appeared in the trailer but the full scene packs a far bigger punch).Aside from the big set pieces, the whole film is beautifully constructed, seems to flow organically from beginning to end. Like the ads say, it feels like \"one long take\" (which it really isn\\'t, but it goes further with that technique than any other film I know of). What that does do, however, is make the action relentlessly personal and individual with the focus on the two messengers, Tom and Will. The two lead actors MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman nail it as two ordinary soldiers asked to do things that no human should have to experience. They are not superheros: the real heroism, for them, is simply surviving and persisting through their own fear and confusion, long enough to get their job done. Bigger names like Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, and Andrew Scott fill roles that are essentially big cameos, but they importantly bookend the story.And I also want to mention Thomas Newman\\'s musical score. It\\'s superb. It\\'s unobtrusive (or silent) when it needs to be, and epic when it needs to be: it emphasizes what\\'s going on without taking over.100 years after the actual events, I don\\'t know if it\\'s possible to get any closer than this to recovering the lived experience of World War I from the viewpoint of the individual soldiers. A great companion piece to \"1917\" would be Peter Jackson\\'s documentary \"They Shall Not Grow Old\" (2018) built from recovered and restored film footage taken during the actual war. It\\'s brilliant too, but in a different way. But it verifies that \"1917\" almost uncannily hits the right notes. WWI can never be portrayed as anything other than horrific, but (maybe for that reason) it\\'s been a magnet for lots of past movies good and bad. Some other recent films that use WWI very effectively though much more briefly in their storylines are \"Passchendaele\" (2008, Canadian-made), \"Tolkien\" (2018), and (yes) \"Wonder Woman\" (2017). But \"1917\" goes past them all.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\\'1917\\' is both a WWI film and a masterclass in cinematography. It\\'s not based on one specific true story or battle, but rather the plot is inspired by stories the director\\'s (Mendes) grandfather told him. From the opening scene, it\\'s clear the \"real-time\" no-cuts concept is going to make the film different, as we meet Corporal Blake (Chapman) and Corporal Schofield (MacKay) and then the camera doesn\\'t leave them for the next 2 hours. They\\'re assigned an urgent mission by a General (Firth), to alert another battalion not to enter what is a German ambush.While set in France, it\\'s filmed in England. The number of extras used is astounding, as is the accuracy of the trenches, barbed wire, ruins and uniforms. The trenches in particular are impressive to see as they walk through them, as they\\'re not just CGI from a distance. From the moment Blake & Schofield step out into no-man\\'s-land, the tension (and score) are ratcheted right up and there\\'s only a few moments of respite.They meet a few helpful soldiers and some Germans on their journey - Captain Smith (Strong) and his troop, Colonel Mackenzie (Cumberbatch) and Blake\\'s brother (Madden). Other than that, only Lauri (Duburcq), a frightened French lady, have any screen time. Thankfully, both the leads are great and easy to cheer for. It\\'s an enthralling ride, with lots of subtle - and not-so-subtle - reminders of the horrors of war. It almost leaves you exhausted, as you feel like you\\'ve been on the mission with them.'},\n",

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in this, I stopped counting at five shots though, because of course that's not it's core strength. Granted it does anchor you in the action, you're right there, something not to be sniffed at, but it's the story and those involved that pulls you in. 1917 is as visceral and terrifying as you'd expect. It'll have your jaw quivering on the floor. The story of two young soldiers attempting to get a message, in a race against time, to save hundreds of their like from near certain death, as the Germans plan a surprise attack. Cramped trenches, open countryside, shell beaten towns, people drifting in and out of the narrative. It could've been complicated, but it's the simplicity that shines here and allows the cinematic hopelessness to weigh on you. If there's one thing that films like this share, it's the common portrayal of the pointlessness of war. Lives lost, friends lost, clinging on to hope and humanaity. To be perfectly honest, it's a struggle to put this into words, but it's brutal, amazing, with a brilliant cast all at the top of their game. Stunning.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I have a special fondness for movies that set technical limitations and still achieve full bodied, engrossing story telling. For example, Stephen Knight's Locke is one man, in a car, by himself - and it's riveting. Die Hard takes place (mostly) in a single blinding. 1917 sets a limitation for itself by presenting the movie as a single continuous shot. (It's really at least three, but that's beside the point.)The rationale is that this would immerse the viewer in the experience of the war. And despite Deakins skill in pulling off the achievement, I think it does the opposite. It's awkward at times, distracting, and gives up the foundational language of film: the power of editing. Some thoughts:Cutting focuses our attention, shifts our point of view, can put us both inside and outside the experience of the characters.The long shots of the characters walking toward the camera in the trenches are off putting. They are completely unlike the way we experience reality - how often do we hold a steady gaze on a single point while walking in real life? It's meant to be subjective and immersive, but it's the opposite.Things get better outside of the trench when the camera has more movement, but get worse in the ruined village, a sequence that looks more like a video game with new pursuers appearing in the channel behind him.The monotony of the single tales had me looking around the frame for the bodies in the mud, pressed in the trench walls, etc. - impressive art direction, but distracting, pulling me out of the story.The bodies sticking out of the mud were supposed to be horrifying, but they struck me as antiseptic. And one reminded me of Davy Jones ship in the second Pirates movie, which made me laugh inappropriately.The real problem is that we have scene this movie before. The plot is the same as Saving Private Ryan, or even Thin Red Line or the Naked and the Dead, which were also built around a single mission. I think Mendes tried to overcome a familiar story with the single take idea. I also think that he can't resist sentimentalizing the story and reaching for unearned emotion.The flaws of the movie are seen in the far to brief appearance of Mark Strong, who is strong, grounded, real, everything the rest of the movie is not. A more cinematic approach, and a story more grounded in human experience, and built out of characterizations like Strong's, would have been much more interesting.As it is, 1917 is a mildly interesting experiment with a conventional story at its center.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"We all talk about story being the paramount bit of making a fantastic movie. Now we big budget blockbusters year round so being amazed by special effects is getting more and more rare. But the cinematography and film making in this was fantastic. Making the movie as if it were one shot was amazing. Saying Roger Deakins is stellar at his job is redundant but he and Mendes make a great team. It was key to this movie being as great as it is, it doesn't feature climactic battle scenes but it is no less thrilling than some other notable pictures in the genre. I'm not a big buff for cinematography, but this was so well captured and masterfully done that I continually was commenting on how beautiful and scary the atmosphere was in this film.While I can't describe 1917 as story focused or dialogue driven, it does run the emotional gauntlet. This movie had me in knots, the tension is thick and they really make you feel the possible consequences their mission failing and how anything could happen at any moment. I've already talked about the cinematography but the flow of the plot brings you in. The unpredictable nature of the story puts you on the edge of your seat and helps you understand how nightmarish and chaotic time this was in history. I laughed (more like chuckled) in this movie, I almost cried and it never felt manipulative or unearned. I was completely drawn in and left the theatre pretty jacked up.Going with some lesser known actors for the leads in this played to this movie's strengths. Some stars going over the line might have been distracting and taken away from the rest of the movie. I didn't realize during that I had seen both George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman but they're a long way from 11/22/63 and Game of Thrones. Both are solid and do an appropriate job showing horror of the situation. My favourite in the supporting performances was Andrew Scott as Lieutenant Leslie. I haven't liked him in anything else but Sherlock but he was pitch perfect here. I also liked Colin Firth and Mark Strong in their respective supporting performances. All the acting in the movie gets the job done and there wasn't an obvious weak performance in the bunch.The complaints I had when watching this movie were few to none. My friend complained a little about some slack pacing but I didn't find a dull moment in this movie. There are quieter and more intimate scenes but I think they were included to sell the gravity of the situation and to let the audience catch a breather. If you're expecting a giant fight, then you might be disappointed but its more of a man on a mission story than a wartime epic.1917 shares many things with recent war hit Dunkirk. Both aren't story-driven, they both drop the audience right in the middle of the action and both feature famous players in supporting parts but trust up-and-comers to lead the way. I think 1917 is the superior film, Dunkirk has the action but I think 1917 does a better job of getting you to care about their characters and showing what it will take to overcome these unbelievable circumstances. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly and provided you're not too squeamish (the movie isn't terribly violent but there's plenty of stuff to make your stomach turn), this is well worth seeing on the big screen. Catch it in theatres when you get the chance\"},\n",

Roger Deakins is one of the best cinematographers of our time. Some shots are mind-blowing. It\\'s hard to imagine how it was shot. Every movie Deakins is involved with looks astonishing and 1917 is no exception. The score, sound editing/mixing, visual effects, and production design are all outstanding.1917 is shot and edited to look like one continuous shot, but that is not the case. This illusion was created with camera trickery and great editing. Sometimes you\\'re able to tell when the camera cuts when darkness obscures the screen for a second or when the camera passes by a wall. Contrary to popular belief, the longest scenes were according to one of the lead actors, Dean-Charles Chapman, only 7- or 8-minutes.I can\\'t begin to fathom the amount of preparation and planning that went into this movie. Creating a war movie to look like one shot from start to finish is not an easy task. It took extreme planning from the director and the cinematographer.The actors give great performances. I did at first not find Chapman and Mackay\\'s performances to be very believable, but it took a quick turn. I did not find it very appropriate for Blake to be cracking jokes whilst being in constant danger. But suddenly the tables flipped, and it got more serious which I enjoyed.When Blake is bleeding out, we can see his face turn pale. This was done without the use of special effects or makeup. I don\\'t know how it\\'s possible, but his face is naturally flushed with color. I think this was an amazing detail and I had no clue it was done without the use of makeup or special effects.Some people might find 1917 to be lacking character and some might call it a \"gimmick film\", which I understand but I don\\'t fully concur. While the plot is simple, the movie still has heart and great action. The last sequence when Schofield is searching for Colonel Mackenzie is great.The first 10 minutes of the movie were flawless. I was engaged and I was thinking how this would be my favorite movie of all time, but I don\\'t think the rest of the movie held this standard. 1917 is still technically one of the greatest movies of all time and it\\'s an enjoyable watch too. I highly recommend you watch it.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Review:\\n'1917' is an epic-war film directed by Sam Mendes. It is based in part on an account told to Sam Mendes by his paternal grandfather, Alfred Mendes.\\nWhat a beautiful film! It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while.\\nThe film chronicles the story of two young British soldiers (Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay) during World War I who are given a mission to call off an attack doomed to fail soon after the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line during Operation Alberich in 1917.\\nWithout trying to sound like an ass, because the source material for this film is so powerful, but the performances from the two leads were mediocre. They make you care about their characters which is important, but they don't really embrace them. We get small parts from Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch who all bring amazing performances in the little screen time they get.\\nThis is a gorgeous film and it's not just due to the fact that it has amazing editing to look like a single shot, but the cinematography is stunning. There was no slow part in the movie and the audience is enthralled with the journey from the first minute of the film.\\nOverall, it's easy to see why this film was nominated for Best Picture along with others. It's an incredible film that should be seen by everybody.\\n5/5\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"First let me say the beginning sequences were shot almost perfectly. I was really into the first 20-25 minutes of the movie. I was engaged and thinking about how I was going to tell my sons that if they get a chance to go watch it in the theater. The cinematography and music were gripping.\\nThen..... as the 2 main characters (solider A and soldier B) get through the initial German traps, and enter into an open field with a cow, a barn, and a pale of fresh milk, the movie goes down hill fast. I was literally laughing at the ridiculousness of the plot and situations. A & B, whose duty it is to transport a message to (2) battalions, warning the battalions are falling into a German trap. Soldier A, has an older brother who is possibly going to be slaughtered in the trap.\\nWith the cow and milk pale in the background, A & B find themselves helping a German airplane pilot out of his burning plane after witnessing an aerial dog fight. This is right after they go through hundreds of yards of seeing their dead countrymen. This is also after they almost get blown up (should have been into 1000 pieces) from booty traps (goonies reference). They help the German guy? Help him? Well, the German guy proceeds to knife Soldier A and kill him. That sequence made me almost leave the theater. I should have because the remaining parts of the movie just got worse. Soldier B still had a message to deliver. B proceeded to get picked up by a convoy of English Soldiers in trucks, who showed up a split second after the cow, milk, plane sequence. As if the trucks showing up was not ridiculous enough, the truck B was in got stuck in the mud moments later. B then convinces 15 or so other soldiers to help him push it out of the mud. Well, they miraculously do this, only to find that they can drive another few hundred yards.\\nOur message delivering solider B leaves them and then now has to make it past the storm trooper German snipers. I call them storm troopers, because just like storm troopers, they are unable to hit their target. On one of the first sniper situations, the sniper gets hit by a bullet, so B thinks. However, when B goes to check to see if he shot the sniper, he opens the door full swing with his entire body facing the wounded sniper. B then takes a bullet? Or something happens where he gets knocked back down a small flight of stairs. After he wakes, he evades some more storm troopers, then kicks open a small horizontal door to find a woman and a baby, along with a beautiful fire. Thankfully B had fresh milk.\\nB then leaves as it is getting close to morning. He evades a couple storm troopers only to find a younger storm trooper that he tries to shush. B actually puts his finger up to the storm trooper to shush him? Huh? Was this part of Jedi training? When that doesn't work he chokes him instead. Much to B's surprise, the choking worked better than the shushing. Go figure?\\nB then runs and runs evading lots of lots of laser guns. Oops sorry, bullets. Then he jumps into a raging river where he smashes his head. Thankfully he has a hard head.\\nIf that is not silly enough, the rivers puts him exactly where he needs to be. Right up to a Battalion sitting in a large circle, listening to a guy singing. UGH, that was so bad.\\nB still needs to get his dry message that was soaked in the river to the commander. He proceeds to evade lots of bombs from enemy fire to do this. But thankfully B makes it. A cameo by Benedict Cumberbatch as the commander cannot save this flop.\\nB saves the second wave. B meets A's brother, even though he was in the first wave that was already deployed and supposed to be slaughtered.I just have to say why? Why do we need to accept these movies and call them Oscar winners? Yes, the cinematography should get an award possibly. Maybe the score. But the overall movie was just plain terrible.\"},\n",

I wasn't expecting the actor for Blake's character to reach the level required, but he surprised me with an excellent performance, all of the cast performed excellently, and the weak part in the film was the lack of war scenes that were almost.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917, is a war film that adds something completely new and unique to the war genre. The idea of making it look like one take is genius, the cinematography is by far the best of the year, as it immerses you deeply into the film and the characters that make you almost feel like you are there on this journey. The film also has a moving ending that had me mesmerised by the time the credits rolled, that is due to the cinematography and the performances given in the film which were very strong, ending on one of the most nicest shots I have seen this year with a quiet moment that says so much when speaking so little. The production, and costume design were also fantastic and the score only enhances your immersion which is exactly what you want in a score.The weak parts to the film however, were there wasn't the greatest character building, especially in moments early on in the film, where I was supposed to feel some kind of emotion I didn't because the character development early on isn't the greatest. I believe as the film progressed this issue eventually sorted itself out which was nice, and also there were quiet moments in the film that felt they dragged on for way too long and needed to be shortened down a little to make a tighter packaged film.Overall 1917 is a film that I found used its cinematography in fantastic fashion and creates a war film that stands up with some of the best, due to its incredible 3rd act. This is pure film making class and will be something that will be studied for aspiring cinematographers in the future.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Saw this film at tiff's secret movie club which was also the film's north American premier. This is a well made war film with technical aspects being really stand out. It is a towering achievement for cinematography, the sound work is top notch, the depiction of front lines, trenches, the mud filled with rotten corpses was incredibly powerful and Sam Mendes did a masterful directing here.However I've had some issues that I think really hurt the film and leave a bad taste:1. There are a few scenes here that probably belong to James Bond flicks than a realistic world war film. I won't spoil anything but I wonder how Mr Mendes would have made this before Skyfall.2. Again there are some events that are highly dramatized and some of them feel just dumb/unrealistic. I don't know how much control did Mendes have on this production but I was really annoyed at certain times.Overall I think this is a worth-watching, expertly made war film that would've been a great one but it's still enjoyable.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I cannot say enough good things about this film. I\\'ve watched it twice in the last three days and could watch it again right now. It\\'s that good.While the trailer made it look enticing, I thought this would just be another lauded film that I ultimately found to be boring. I couldn\\'t have been more wrong.The camera work alone is incredible. Many films have done the \"one shot\" gimmick but here it is superbly done. At times you completely forget that you\\'ve been watching a continuous take (and you stop looking for the hidden cuts). The way the camera moves is so impressive and you are continuously engaged. Before I watched this I thought, \"How can this movie be a continuous shot and everything happens in just two hours?\" But somehow it just worked. I can\\'t imagine how much hard work was put into this movie, but it was worth it and totally paid off. And Thomas Newman\\'s score is absolute perfection.I admittedly am not a fan of war-related movies for the sole reason of how uncomfortable they make me. I don\\'t do realistic, brutal violence and suffering. But 1917 is not your typical war movie. While it does show the horrors of war it doesn\\'t base its story on that. Instead you have a dramatic thriller of a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, rooting for the hero. Even when the pace slows down it\\'s never for long, as time is of the essence. Also, the acting goes above and beyond here. I can only imagine how grueling it was to be in such a physically demanding role. Running, climbing, jumping, shooting, etc. for such long shots over and over. Everyone must have been exhausted.I truly think 1917 is epic and is one of the best movies I\\'ve ever seen. It\\'s been so long since I\\'ve watched a movie that I didn\\'t feel was a waste of time.I wish I could personally thank everyone involved in the making of this.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Sometimes I watch a Film that comes highly recommended - and can find it a little disappointing. '1917' was more than that - it struck me very soon into the Film that, whatever story this was, it was so Fictionalised it bore no semblance to the reality of the Year it was trying to portray. Supposedly the 6th April 1917 two (yes, TWO) British Soldiers are ordered to make their way forward to make contact with a British Unit that is being led into a 'trap' with orders to stop any such assault. I would like to say that there is more to the story than that BUT there isn't. The Film is shot in an apparent 'one continuous take' pseudo-documentary way which occasionally rankles. Make no mistake though, the Cinematography by Roger Deakins FULLY deserves the Oscar it was awarded - it is just that the actual depiction of WW1 and story make no sense whatever. There are real issues - firstly, I never felt that the dialog or the actors were in 'period' being too 21st Century and not Early 20th (for how to do this see 'Gettysburg' where the lines and pace of the actors match the 19th Century). Secondly, the story unfolds across a landscape in which all the elements are there BUT you never get the REAL horror of what it was truly like to fight in this hell-hole. I'm not even going to comment on some of the more absurd aspects. A General in a front-line dugout? Not likely! Save 1600 men from an ambush - by sending TWO? A RAT setting off a booby-trap in a German underground bunker? I could go on but it is pointless.\\nThe only 'enemy' to appear are not even stereotypes, just absurd - a German pilot who survives a flaming crash in his Albatros fighter because our two heroes pull him from the flaming wreckage - immediately decides to pull a knife and attack one of them. What?? The other German soldiers also conform to the 'Star Wars Stormtrooper Complex' - where, despite their military reputation, they simply cannot shoot straight. These would be the same troops who, the previous year, caused horrific casualties to the British on The Somme.\\nOverall, this is a very well-made piece of Cinema BUT simply is NOT accurate in it's depiction of the 'Great War' and feel an opportunity has been missed.\\nI even felt that it's award of the Oscar for 'Best Visual Effects' was undeserved as they just weren't good at all (that Oscar should have gone to Alita: Battle Angel).\\nOnce again, too many British Film critics were happy to jump on the Mendes bandwagon calling this a 'masterpiece' - it isn't - Kubrick's 'Paths Of Glory' is WAY superior to this....\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester this afternoon - 1917. Throughout the years there have been many films, starring many people, and coming from many different points of view about the First World War. Without taking anything away from those film makers who have come before I can say this was certainly one of the best shot films I have seen for a long time. Following just two soldiers for much of the first half you get a real insight into the life of the individual. Yes we know thousands of men died on both sides but the way this film is shot isolates the very individual struggles and emotions felt by men under direct orders to carry out a seemingly impossible task. Even when surrounded by hundreds of other men there is a sense of aloneness emanating from the screen. I particularly liked how the camera angles changed direction whilst the soldiers were walking, one minute the camera is going backwards, the next it swings round as it allows the men to pass and you almost get a feeling of the cameraman trotting to keep up as they purposely stride along on their mission. Take a moment to look beyond the characters, note the detritus of war lying around, items of clothing, munitions, and so many bodies. Remember this is real, it did happen and note the horror of it all. Lots of big stars in very small parts, look out for Colin Firth, Mark Strong to name a couple. Well done Sam Mendes, you have excelled yourself with this masterpiece.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is directed by Sam Mendes and is a film centred around 2 soldiers in Wold War 1. This movie has received so much praise for its technical achievements. 1917 pulls off the impossible, by creating a wholesome one shot experience. At times the camera will start as handheld then it is hooked on a wire then moved onto a vehicle all in one shot just to capture the journey of the soldiers. This makes for one of the most immersive experiences I have ever had in a film. This is largely due to the cinematographer Roger Deakins. This man is a genius. His subtle camera work makes you truly feel like you are in the moment. The movie feels so real and so authentic, because every shot is always in service of the story. The musical score by Thomas Newman does a great job of feeling so tragic yet beautiful at the same time. This mixture of emotions really overwhelms you when the movie chooses to slow down and reflect. That was my favourite thing about 1917. The movie contains such a powerful story. For most the simple plot and lack of backstory given to us about the characters is a big issue. I've heard many critics say this movie is style over substance. I couldn't disagree more. This movie feels like I am visiting a war memorial and reading about the experience of a soldier during the Great War. 1917 places you right beside the main characters, seeing glimpses and hearing short stories about their life along the journey. This is what it would have been like. These men didn't know each other. It was the way they responded to hardship which would reveal traits of their character. The movie doesn't feed you this information with expository dialogue, but through scenes where the camera just pauses on the soldiers face, while they internally reflect upon all they have been through. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I truly believe 1917 is one of the best war movies ever made. It's subtlety is genius. I haven't been this emotionally moved by a film in over a year. It just requires a bit of deeper thinking and reflection in order to create a personal connection with the characters. I wish more movies were made with this much passion.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I sometimes fear we\\'re running out of stuff to do with the War Movie - to me, this is a genre particularly prone to redundancy, cliché, and cheese. But with 1917, Sam Mendes aspires to do for World War I what Spielberg did for II, creating a sort of complete immersion that never lets us disconnect from the ever-treacherous wartime setting. This is largely due to the presentation; the entire movie looks like one long, uninterrupted shot!Of course, the film isn\\'t truly done in one take, instead creating the illusion of it with editing and effects like those of Birdman. There have been genuine attempts at a one-shot movie before (like Utøya, Russian Ark, and Victoria), but they came with the hiccups that will inevitably arise when one tries to do live theater plus shifting locations plus special effects plus a purposely limited camera crew. And of course, many of Andy Warhol\\'s \"films\" were technically done in one take. It needn\\'t always be an impressive thing to do.1917, however, is quite impressively made, even when you can deduce when and where it hides its cuts and gives the cast and crew a well-deserved break. As mentioned, we still feel wholly trapped in the setting, which is both due to the lack of cuts and the fact that we view the world-shaking horrors exclusively from the point-of-view of two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman), sent on a suicide mission to deliver one simple message.Problems arise when we reach the film\\'s slower moments, which aren\\'t made that much more admirable on a technical level just because the actors converse in an uninterrupted session (even during the purely \"talky\" and small-scale bits, Birdman had more directing going on in its lengthy takes). Granted, these moments are some of the film\\'s most human, supplying a somber breather in-between busy trenches, suspenseful action, and horrific, squalid battle sites.The most popular complaint seems to be of Thomas Newman\\'s music, which can be overbearing and, rather than enhancing the emotions, damage scenes that would\\'ve been more powerful, immersive, and intense without it; I only partly agree. Another complaint is mainly popular on Film Twitter (my favorite place), where people sincerely question why we still make movies about the World Wars - which, in spite of what I said about irritating war film clichés, isn\\'t exactly the sort of tacit celebration of historical ignorance I wish to humor.A few of the inevitable cuts are pretty obvious too (one is willfully obvious, creating an intermission point in the very middle), even attempting to merge two shots with slight but noticeable differences in lighting. But there is still so much to admire in terms of special effects, coordination, camera movement, production design, and indeed, the effective use of lighting (especially in a scene where threatening ruins are lit exclusively by a flare) that it doesn\\'t matter much. Much of the time, the execution lives up to Mendes\\' ambition.Our leads also carry the film nicely; they work as focal characters on top of sharing genuine history and chemistry, as we also admire their devotion. Perhaps celebrity cameos like those of Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch will distract from the realism and immersion, but this will hardly be true of every viewer. I conclude that this is a pretty damn good film overall and that it should at the very least win some techies this Sunday. I won\\'t go for my highest rating (my #KeepingUpWithTheOscars fave remains Little Women and Parasite remains by Best Picture vote), but I sincerely believe that - with the climactic shot of Lance Corporal William Schofield running alongside the Pas-de-Calais trench as the final attack breaks loose around him, driven only by his devotion to the mission - Mendes has created one of the most iconic sequences of our age\\'s cinema.Finally, on the note of historical accuracy, you may not need to worry so much with this one. 1917 isn\\'t based on any particular event within World War I, instead dramatizing a tale Mendes\\' grandfather used to tell him and his siblings. Thus, we can\\'t be sure 1917 is based on a true story at all. You know what grandpas can be like.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Like most WWI and WWII movies made today, this one looks like modern day actors playing soldier, all lacking military bearing, speech, phrasing and decorum of the time. If the viewer thinks to ask, what brand hair oil from the year 1917 might these two message runners use, the answer at the shampooed non-oiled fluffy hair is, of course, none because men today do not use hair cream. The movie is 1917, and clearly not made in 1917.Also, like most big war movies made by nonmilitary people, when out in the open at the front lines, the actors mostly look 10 to 15 feet ahead. They do not have \"the 1000 yard gaze\" and do not rubberneck their view to constantly be aware of 360° of their environment.But there is a special problem with the movie 1917 that makes it tough to watch through to the end, and that is that it has a clear bothersome pattern, or dramatic plot giveaway. As the two messengers are trekking, urgently moving on their mission, there is no drama. As the two messengers are moving, we see they are not at risk. But each time they stop to explore (and this is weird because stopping and exploring is not part of their urgent mission), each time they stop, great problems fall upon them.One problem is booby-traps by the retreating enemy. You would think that once the first booby-trap is found and inflicts a painful toll, the two messengers would be extremely cautious to even think about stopping and exploring again, but they do. And yes, as they have stopped and are spending time exploring without caution, more great problems fall upon them.Also, after experiencing a booby-trap first hand, even if stopping again to recklessly touch and explore things around them was somehow acceptable, there should still be some concern for the two messengers that the outdoor paths and wood boardwalks that were all enemy territory just hours ago are now mined. Actually, the Germans made extensive use of anti-tank landmines during WWI. Landmines were the \"cheap\" weapon of WWI. Yet, although complicated booby-traps were set by the Germans in the movie 1917, no quick and easy landmines are on the main paths of the newly abandoned German territory, and these two actors seem to know there are no landmines as they walk on top of boardwalks and paths.1917 is less than realistic.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'One of my most anticipated films of 2019 was 1917. What makes this film so grand is it\\'s emotional power, technical innovation, and unforgettable attention to detail. What has attracted so many audiences is the camerawork. The camerawork has been praised so much it might seem like overselling it. If anything, we\\'re underselling it. It is designed as two extraordinarily long, unbroken shots. It puts you directly into the film as though you\\'re the third person in the mission. But this film does something very special and that is how you often forget about the \"gimmick\" because of the masterful story and the tour de force, starmaking performance from George MacKay who brings so much physicality and emotion to each and every sequence in the film.The writing is straight forward. It\\'s about two British soldiers\\' treacherous mission across enemy lines in France. It excels in realizing its scenario with each set piece. Simple and straight forward to be sure, but shows how to do simple and straight forward the right way.The technical work is outstanding work all across the board. The sound, the visual effects, and of course the sheer size, detail and greatness of the production design. It\\'s amazing work throughout such as the mine, No Man\\'s Land, or the destroyed town. Beautiful stuff. The cinematography is one of Deakins\\' greatest achievements. It brings you into every shot. Every shot that is so gorgeous in its visual details of so many kinds. I mean he has amazing scenes of the grey No Man\\'s Land, he also somehow finds the most photogenic way to show foxhole gridlock, it is fascinating. He creates just one painting after another He creates a beauty to every time or type of day. The shot of the changing flares/bombed out city is one of the greatest shots of all time and in itself is worthy of an Oscar win.The score might be one of the most underrated aspects of the film. It\\'s tremendous and it\\'s Newman\\'s crowning achievement.This in creating such gorgeous pieces of work, that does definitely owe a debt to Zimmer\\'s work for Thin Red Line and Dunkirk, making use of every bit of his orchestra. This in creating work essential to each scene in building the tension of every sequence, while also just being incredibly beautifully grand pieces on their own.Sam Mendes does not waste one thing at his disposal. Everything matters. Everything clicked.. Whether it be the production design, Deakins, the sound, the score, the effects and even the editing that makes it all invisible. This is a must watch for fans of Mendes, war films, or just great movies in general. It brought me chills and left my mouth wide open several times. Anything short of an Oscar would be a disservice. I can\\'t wait to watch it again.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This movie is utterly incredible. Obviously from a technical point of view. The editing is flawless. You can make guesses where the cuts were made logistically, but they really are seamless. You can tell that they really put a lot of work into the film and it was simply breathtaking. The \"continuous shot\" isnt a new concept but it was done brilliantly for a film like this. It\\'s more than a cool technical gimmick...it really makes you feel like you\\'re on this journey too. And the action, and tension just never lets off. Well, at least until the very end. You\\'re just in constant fear and sadness for these guys. And George MacKay who pretty much carries this whole film is absolutely brilliant and I think should be getting more attention this awards season. If he wasn\\'t good, I dont think the film would be as successful despite the technical achievement.If I had to mention one slight problem, is that if you have seen the trailers or even just THAT clip of George Mackay running through a battlefield with bombs going off (which is a brilliant scene) you know that he is alone. So *SPOILER* it wasnt that much of a shock when his friend died. It was still sad for sure. But like, I think it might have been a bit better if felt like it came out of nowhere. More like how George MacKay\\'s character would have felt. But, honestly thats just one small gripe and I rather liked how the character\\'s death was dealt with. I actually quite liked the scene right afterwards when he\\'s in the truck and the other soldiers are having a conversation and joking around and then there\\'s just Mackay\\'s chaarcter (William) just sitting solemnly trying to process what just happened. Its a great juxtaposition. And then much later on when William is floating in the river, barely holding on and the cherry blossoms start falling down him. It felt like it was a symbol of hope or a message from his friend from beyond the grave to not give up. It was a nice and touching addition to the film. The only other small thing I will mention is that since the film seems to primarly follow William, a lot of the big name actors that you see on the poster or in trailers like Colin Firth or Benedict Cumberbatch for example feel like a cameo. In it for like maybe a 5 minutes and then gone. I mean, it makes sense story wise, but still a little, I don\\'t know, jarring? But really, on the whole the film is amazing. If you want a film to put you right in the middle of war, then this is it.'},\n",

The only emotional scene was in the final 30 seconds, Everything else, basically was implausible.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Breathtaking. Visually breathtaking. That's probably what I would use to describe the film. 1917 is a film that use a continouously long one-shot in its entirety, like Birdman. And the efforts to make that alone should be applauded. Using a simple story settings, 1917 soars in the technical aspect as well as the narrative.The film uses a very simple and easy to understand settings: deliver a message. The protagonist is basically a messenger. However, the mission is no easy task; making it a very good story to told. The film waste no moment in introducing its main characters and their mission, making you feel the importance of the mission at hand.This film is very gripping to say the least. The layers of the film is slowly peeled off, making it a very slow steady ride at first. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, just to occassionally push you back to the end of it. The sequence is well thought and set up, so much so that you'll feel the build up rising little by little.Another thing that I liked is the film uses very close shot to shoot the film, making you feel like you're there with the characters. It feels like you're riding a roller-coaster, and a very frightening one. Or like you're playing a World War 1 horror video game. Coupled that with the IMAX superb surround sound system, making it a very satisfying viewing and listening experience.The score of the film is also a main component in influencing your emotions. Whether to be sad, suspense or makes your blood pumping, Thomas Newman's score is there every step of the way. He knows when to use any cue to make you wary of the lying threat surrounding the main characters. Hats off to him.All in all, 1917 is a very immersive experience. This is maybe a once in a lifetime chance. I highly recommend you watch the film. Definitely watch this in IMAX if you have the chance to do so. It makes a world of a difference. Guaranteed you're not going to regret it. A 5 out of 5.P/S: I liked this film better than Dunkirk. But having said that, both aren't the same type of film and should't be compared because both are masterpieces in their own regard. Take that as you will.\"},\n",

If the message is not received in time, 1,600 men including Corporal Blake's brother will be killed.REVIEW SUMMARY:\\nThere is so much in this film to love. Obviously, although it's been done before, the form of directing where it appears to be one continuous shot throughout, really adds to the intensity of the film. The sound editing is done really well and the score is so good except for one scene where it feels like a very misplaced fantasy-like score. There are so many memorable moments in this film, but for me the film gets a bit slow for me. It's understandable as you can't have constant action from beginning to end for a film like this, but it doesn't disregard the fact that it does cause the film to get slightly boring for me at moments. If I was one that could get past those slow moments, this would probably be my favorite film of the year and so if you can really get on board with both the intense and not-so intense moments, you will love this film. The ending really topped off for me as well. A really good film and I definitely recommend this film especially in theaters and if you can, Dolby. 7.9/10.--------------------------------------BREAKDOWN-------------------------------------------DIRECTION:\\nSam Mendes truly did something special with this film. Going with the one-shot illusion added SO much to this film. You feel part of the battle with the characters. This directing style for a war film really immerses you with the battle. The intense moment become that much more intense and it makes it feel that much more real. There's one moment where it fades to black and then continues right where it left off and continues the rest of the way as one continuous shot and it amazing to feel like your watching a live stream of two soldier's struggle with fear and courage while trying to get a very important message across enemy territory. Bravo on the direction here and I definitely feel Sam Mendes deserves Best Director at the Oscars.WRITING:\\nNormally, I'd go into detail with the writing, however, I feel if I were to get too deep with the writing that I'd be potentially spoiling the movie so I'll leave something short. I think the decisions made with the writing were delivered very good. As I've mentioned, there are intense moments and they are written very well. You don't know when things are coming and that leads to impressive payoff. There was a point during the movie where I thought of a story idea, based off a film like this, but then they literally did what I was thinking so... scratch that I guess.ACTING:\\nThe acting in this is phenomenal. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay were incredible in this. There was one moment where MacKay was supposed to be crying and it was an impactful moment, however, it wasn't the best as far as a cry goes. Damn, I must sound like a nit-picky b****, but hey it's important in my opinion. When someone cries I want to feel it and I could empathize and understand why he broke down, but I just put myself in that position and it wasn't really because I felt his pain specifically. Anyway, he was still very good and I really enjoyed Dean-Charles Chapman performance. I wouldn't put either performances up for Best Actor this year and that's really just a testament to how stacked that pool is this year. So many amazing performances including these, but I really feel this film shined through the direction. There was an incredible moment that did hit me in the feels at the end of the film with one of the actors and although it was very short, I loved it. I can't really expand on that here.\"},\n",

The entire movie uses extraordinarily clever camera tricks to appear as though the entire feature was shot in one take.

You feel their claustrophobia when they're almost buried by a German booby trap, experience the same relief when they reach daylight again and react to gunshots with the same surprise and fear. Towards the end, the shots speed up with the characters, expertly portray their urgency to complete their mission. The stubtle ways the camera shows the harsh realities of war and unnecessary loss of life is masterful and the two main characters are three dimensional, real people, who didn't deserve to be in such a harsh situation. This movie absolutely deserves its best cinematography and best director nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards and I sincerely hope that it wins in both categories. This movie is a must see.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I saw \"1917\", starring George MacKay-Captain Fantastic, Peter Pan_2003; Dean_Charles Chapman-Blinded By the Light, Game of Thrones_tv; Richard Madden-Rocketman, Game of Thrones_tv and Colin Firth-the Mamma Mia! movies, the Kingsman movies.\\nThis is a WW1 movie that is inspired by the director\\'s grandfather\\'s experiences, \\'The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1879_1991\\'. Sam Mendes is the director and writer, who also directed Spectre, Skyfall and Road to Perdition. The film is shot and edited to make it look like it is one long shot that takes place in real time. It takes place in April of 1917 and follows two British soldiers, George & Dean, who are given an important mission: Get a message to fellow soldiers behind enemy lines that are about to launch an attack against German soldiers. If they fail to notify their fellow soldiers, the Germans will spring a trap on the Allies and over 1,600 men will be massacred, including Dean\\'s brother, Richard. Colin is the General that gives George and Dean their orders and there are several cameos, including Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch. The action scenes look great and realistic as George and Dean make their way across enemy territory, determined to succeed in their mission. It is a visceral look at war.\\nIt\\'s rated \"R\" for violence, disturbing images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes.\\nIf you are a war movie fan, you will probably enjoy this one. I did and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.'},\n",

It's a war movie but far from something that we are used to watch, what we did get was a very real portrayal of The Great War and everything horrible about it.\\nRight from the start we get introduced to the two characters and they then start their adventure, it does not take a long while to the true horrors of WW1 to be shown to us and its what the actors, script and direction succeeded in doing, creating an incredible experience.The production design is just extraordinary, sets most of all. To think of all the trenches they dug and everything else, it's amazing how hard all the crew worked to create this masterpiece. Cinematography was simply superb, giving us shots that makes us immersed, focusing on the environment and everything on the screen when the actors aren't in the focus made us feel the shocking sights the soldiers had to see everyday. Musical score was one other highlight, keeping us suspense with music fitting a war movie. Why should you watch this movie, a war movie that earned 10 nominations in the Oscar's. You'll experience something totally unique, visually stunning that makes your eyes stick to the screen and witnessing acting that portrays realistic soldiers. It's a masterpiece in its genre and in film!\"},\n",

There is almost constant tension throughout the film, which keeps you on your seat just expecting something awful to happen to our characters at every turn.A fantastic depiction of the chaos of war and the cheapness with which human life can be discarded and at the same time, the huge efforts that can be taken to preserve it. It has certainly reignited my interest in the history of the First World War, and will be reading up on it ASAP!A triumph, well worth seeing, you won't be disappointed!\"},\n",

I think that I might\\'ve expected too much something like FJ, but it was nothing alike. Yet, a great war film.1917 is a film about two messangers in WWI, trying to warn the soldiers in the new front lines that the Germans set a trap, and to cancell the attack. It\\'s quite minimalistic in terms of dialogue and plot, but it doesn\\'t take away from the whole experience.I have very few criticisms towards 1917, so let\\'s start with that: I find the pacing a bit weird from time to time (seldom, maybe twice), mainly because It\\'s made to look like a one shot. I also found one or two scenes a bit cliche (in the aspect of war films cilches), but not something awful.Now, to the things that I liked - the film is visually amazing. The one shot thing absorbs you into the battlefield completely, and every little item on the set was carefully crafted and placed. The acting is also great, and the score is good as well. I love the subtle ways in which we learn about war\\'s nature and the personality of our two main characters.And also, the way that the film ends, and the focus on two soldiers makes everything feel like \"another day on the battlefield\". As one of the characters said, more or less: \"On sunday they\\'ll send a letter telling us to attack on dawn\". The one day in which the film takes place is just another day.To sum it all: A great, immersive war film, with amazing production and creative film making techniques.P.s: I wish I saw this one on theaters instead of home, on my PC. Just feels like a movie that deserves the whole Cinemtaic experience.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Just finished watching 1917. I start by saying that I don't know how to find the right words to express my current emotional status.The first thing that comes to my mind about the movie is the style of directing. It was a bold choice, because of course you don't always see movies shot in that way, but I'm a 100% sure that it paid off. It really made you dive into the story, the characters' feelings and the details of the ruined war places you see. Furthermore, you see only one real and direct transition from scene to scene. That particular transition was also the audience's emotional transition, since I think it divides the movie into two main moments. That change of feeling, mood, and action made the viewers change emotionally, since it's clear that the movie is coming to an end, even though, you really can't expect anything anytime, because Sam Mendes knows what is doing.The cinematography is simply amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if it won an Oscar for that. The importance of colour is really highlighted, and it plays a really huge part in the film. I think that the relationship between colour and audience is real. Colour makes you emotionally weak, strong, anxious and frightened, and I can go on but the emotions I experienced are too many. Colour is the lead of the movie.One of the best parts of the movie was the original score. Since I care deeply about music in movies, I can say that I was not disappointed. Music accompanied colour in every moment of the movie, creating an atmosphere that really can't be explained. (There's a very intense scene when George Mackay's character arrives in the french village, where colour and music work together, as the protagonist runs trying to save himself)\\nI really want this aspect of the movie to be acknowledged.I want this movie to do well, because it deserves it. I can't wait for the Oscars and I can't wait seeing this movie win.\"},\n",

The camera work from 14 times Academy Award nominee cinematographer Rodger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049) is outstanding and yet reminds of Private Ryan it surpasses it without the gory details but still puts you on the edge of your seat. It is a movie that you can connect with either if you have been in the army or not because it is a movie for all. It is a message, it is a wake-up call for the atrocities of war, and this is a war that happens now, in front of your eyes. The camera is so strong that it has some kind of documental feel that evokes some frames of Peter Jackson\\'s \"They Shall Not Grow Old\" from 2018 where he puts never-before-seen footage to commemorate the centennial of the end of the war.Someone has said that that the war movies should not be glorified with a soundtrack but what a soundtrack this movie has! My ow my. I just want to mention one name here: Thomas Newman.Another interesting fact. In this movie, you cannot feel the special effects. It is for the first time that I am not feeling tricked by any CGI or computer gimmicks. Whatever they used here they used it wisely without breaking the balance between cinema and documentary and the final result is mesmerizing. It a disorientating, captivating, .It was filmed and edited as if it was one long take and the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. The plot is rather simple: you follow two young soldiers ordered to deliver a message which will save 1,600 other soldiers.It is a second war movie from Sam Mendes after Jarhead and it deserves special recognition from the movie industry. It is a movie to be talked about in the future because of its authenticity and the special message that it contains'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The pretentious camera work with these pathetic continuous long shots is just all showboating garbage to 'win' awards. YAWN. It;s been done to death Sam. Theres nothing special about the cinematography. It;s not bad, but takes away any intimacy of any scene. Think of Platoon then look at this mess. No where near the calibre of Platoon. You are literally a fly on the wall thoughout the entire film. The main character Schofield was a total wimp, posh boy, and a moron to boot. His friend was just as useless. Glad he got shanked and died, he was a moron as well. So many stupid things they do that just makes you shake your head in disbeleif:1) Kicking over a bucket of hot coals and talking loudly while you have just arrived in a German trench. What a fabulous idea! A rat (lol) sets off a trip wire and both characters get blown back and not a scratch on them.2) Not paying attention while exiting the crumbling trench and chatting like they are going for a stroll in their local park. Not looking out for other trip wires or landmines or enemies. Never taking a moment to take cover and observe buildings before they approach. They just walk right up to everything in the open.3) Helping a downed German pilot rather than blowing his brains out or letting him burn to death. Instead they help him and fat boy manages to let the German pilot gut him with a knife. Serves you right. Then he dies. Good. Knew it was coming anyway. Theres gratitude for you from the German. Then posh boy finds some delicious fresh milk and bottles it, then magically out of nowhere another battalion teleport to his location without making a sound to give him a ride. How convenient!4) When he is dropped off, the German sniper/rifleman was literally 20 feet away and should/could have been shooting at them all, but waits until posh boy is alone and then lets off shots. Posh boy nails him pretty quickly with precision aim. The convoy would have heard that shot and gone back to help him. But not in this movie.5) Posh boy goes into the building where the sniper is and opens the door to the room the sniper is in, completely exposing himself and the sniper is still alive. They both take a shot at each other and it's CLEARLY implied posh boy takes a bullet to the chest/torso and flies backwards down the stairs knocking himself out. Yet he wakes up and hasn't been shot? I'm guessing his canteen bottle saved him? Great directing there.6) It;s at this point where you wonder WTF posh boy is doing as he exits the building at night with flares going up in the air and he just meanders along like a sitting duck along the main path way, instead of legging it to the sides amongst the ruins for much better cover. It it because he is concussed? He seems to be alert enough to know whats going on but makes pi$$ poor choices.7) I couldnt beleive it when he stands infront of a huge burning building, yet again exposed, and sees another soldier approaching. Instead of thinking oh $hit, it might be a German, he walks TOWARD the soldier like oh hey dude hows it going, and then the soldier shoots at him. It only then clicks that its a German and he starts running. Jesus wept.7) The German misses him and doesnt see him scramble into a hatch underground, and then meets a French girl with a baby, puts down his gun, sits down, and chills. The German soldier is obviously looking for him and is not far away, and there could be more, but yet again reality goes out the window for some reason. I won't even bother with a milk bit.8) He;s back on his feet and more Germans spot him and shoot at him, missing. Posh boy sees a German soldier drunk and puking up, then runs into a German his own age, pinning him up against a pillar and puts his hand over his mouth then lets go. The German predictably yells to his drunk buddy so posh boy strangles him. Seriously, you are alone surrounded by Germans and think you can barter with them to shut up? What did he think the German dude was going to do even if he kept his mouth shut? Where is posh boy's survival instict? He's too soft and should be as brutal and unforgiving as he can in his circumstance, but nooooooo.9) It's at this point I really was fed up with the dire writing. Posh boy leaves his gun, his ONLY gun on the floor, where as he had time to pick it up and EASILY bayonet the incapacitated German to death but instead shoves him over and legs it! Hahahaha. So he runs and runs while more Germans shoot at him and jumps off a ledge into rapids which didnt exist there in real life.10) You still with me? God bless ya. Well, posh boy is washed down the river til he reaches a load of dead floating corpses, climbs over them, crawls onto the embankment and has a good cry. He can't beleive he gave his munch to the French bird as hes starving. He then walks through a woodland area and hears singing (you couldnt make it up). And how lovely, the battalion he has fought so so hard to reach are all sitting there listening to the soothing voice of a soldier singing. Cringe.11) He runs above the trench dodging shells like Mr Invinceable to deliver a letter to Bend-a-dik Cumber-B!tch, who tells him to eff aaawf after receiving the letter and reading it, and calling off the attack. Posh boy meets his dead mates olde brother, then the film ends with him leaning up against a tree, just like at the beginning of the film, except fat boy is dead.The end. Utter guff and grossly over rated. Platoon kicks 1917's a$$.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"World War 1 is a war that is drastically underrated and under used in Hollywood. To be completely honest, I'm getting tired of World War 2 movies, they're mostly the same thing but with different characters. So when 1917 came out, I was ecstatic because World War 1 would finally get the recognition it deserves. 1917 is more of a drama than a war movie, and I love it; you can only see soldiers killing each other for so long. 1917 is about two men trying to survive what's happening around them. The war is just a backdrop mostly throughout the runtime, so it feels like a breath of fresh air in the war genre because you're not constantly being bombarded with people getting shot and blown up.I love how simple the plot is; it's just two men trying to send a message across a war zone. Everything about the plot and the writing is perfect. It's intense, it's sad, and it has great pacing. 1917 is also realistic, none of the characters are superheroes; they get hurt and make mistakes. 1917 is a history lesson too, it depicts the trenches exactly how it was in real life. The war torn landscapes are also depicted very well, as it shows corpses stuck in the mud, which took away a lot of lives during World War 1. I love the history of World War 1, and 1917's writers really did their research, because it shows it in the final product.By far the most impressive aspects of 1917 is how beauty it is. The cinematography is amazing with these wide landscape shots. 1917 is just such a beautiful film to watch, even though there's constant imagery of war. The most impressive part about 1917 is how it looks like it was shot in one continuous take. Filming this way is extremely difficult; you need great camera work and choreography, but when it's all said and done, it's so satisfying. You also need smart editing to blend in all of the shots.Last thing I want to mention is the acting. Both George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman did a fantastic job. They made the characters so believe by their body language, showing how tired and hurt they are. With 1917 having almost no exposition, somehow they've made these characters so likable and understanding. All we need to see is sacrifice and determination to make these characters understanding, and the writers did exactly that.I love 1917, it was amazing in every aspect. I already knew Sam Mendes was a great director, but to direct a project this difficult and make it look easy forces me to respect him even more. The acting, the cinematography, and the simple plot made 1917 a joy to watch. All I can say is that 1917 was definitely worth my money.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"After reviewing movies for many years I have a sort of formula when it comes to writing about the films I watch. If the movie is really bad I tend to write the review straight away so I can get it out of my mind and never have to think about it again. When a film is good, as I find most are, then I tend to wait two to three days to collect my thoughts, do some background research and write it with a clear mind. But occasionally I see a film which absolutely blows me away. These types of films come around rarely but when they do I have to really sit back, take a deep breath and comprehend just how I'm going to convey how good it is in words. 1917 is that type of film - a movie that displays technical wizardry behind the camera and amazing work in front of it. It's been six days since I've watched 1917 and I'm still in absolute awe of what I witnessed!The year is of course 1917. Deep in the heart of France British soldiers battle the Germans in what appears to be insurmountable odds. It's on the battlefield that we meet two young soldiers, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George Mackay). They've just been assigned an impossible mission by General Erinmore (Colin Firth): travel by foot behind enemy lines, avoiding German snipers and artillery, to find a British battalion that is about to walk into a trap set up by the Germans. It's a task so dangerous it will probably cost both men their lives, but if they fail it will lead to the massacre of 1,600 British soldiers. Adding to the urgency of the assignment, Blake's older brother is one of the 1,600 soldiers about to walk into the ambush!THE GOODAfter reading the above description you're probably wondering what makes this film so spellbinding. Well it's the way that it has been filmed that really puts it above other war films. Director Sam Mendes (Skyfall, American Beauty) and cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, Blade Runner 2049) have collaborated to come up with a style of filming that makes it look like one long tracking shot that never takes a break or cuts away.\\nWe follow soldiers Blake and Schofield all the way through their mission in real time: walking though crowded bunkers, dodging snipers and crawling through mud as if we are there with them. As an audience member it's disorienting, confronting and an absolute cinematic masterpiece like I've never witnessed before. This is a film that just HAS TO be seen in the cinema to get the full experience. It's a movie that really shows the horrors of war with scenes that will shock you and sounds that will scare you. A lot of people may compare it to Saving Private Ryan but I think it may even be better than that!THE BADApart from a couple of nit-picky things there is nothing bad about this movie. There are cameos galore where the famous actor always has his back toward the camera and then dramatically turns around as if to say 'look it's me!', and a lot of the story does fall into place rather too nicely, but nothing took away from my enjoyment or made me feel as I was watching 'just another movie'. Throughout this film's two hour running time I felt as if I was on this mission with these two soldiers and absolutely nothing took me out of it until the very end credits.THE UGLYMendes has managed to capture the horrors of war in full, gory detail. From dirty, rat infested bunkers to brutal deaths and amputations, nothing is off limits as 1917 definitely doesn't glamorise what these brave men in the British armed forces had to go through. It may not be easy to watch for those of you with a weak stomach but it is probably a very accurate portrayal of what really happened in World War One.The saying 'you have to see it to believe it' is an accurate statement when talking about 1917. Nothing I write will do justice to the film which definitely requires a second viewing to fully take it in. It's war and it's ugly but the way it has been told is just as engrossing as what is being told. A must see at the cinema!FIVE MILITARY MEDALS OUT OF FIVE\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This film is an immersive and wholly impactful experience showing viewers just how visceral and hellish it was to be in combat during World War I. Directed by Sam Mendes and stunningly shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins, this film tells the story of two young British soldiers who are given orders by their superior to deliver a message to prevent an attack in a seemingly distant area of France. The film is (mostly) shot and tightly edited to appear akin to one continuous shot that grabs the viewer\\'s attention and never lets go.The intensity of the film is almost heart-stoppingly powerful. Viewers really feel the tension and anguish that countless young men were forced into during the war. The use of tracking shots and differentiating scope and scale further make the film\\'s war action seem even more impactful. Its production design is outstanding, with unbelievably detailed recreations of various landscapes of the Western Front. Two the surprise of no one, Deakins\\' cinematography is remarkable both in its ambition and its execution. The film is incredibly well-acted, and also manages to develop its characters well, almost placing their current states of being into a figurative tapestry summing up the film\\'s primary messages and intended takeaways about the war in the exact moment in which it is set. All of the film\\'s scenes and major setpiece moments are superbly edited not only to look like one take, but to establish stunning tightness and cohesion to the narrative.While the film is undoubtedly great, it\\'s not quite perfect because it could have used some contextualization about what exactly was going on in the war during this exact time in 1917. Even though I\\'m a history buff to some extent and knew the basics of that, I would have appreciated some more specific information. It would have been possible to do this without breaking the film\\'s \"one-shot\" style, as such context could have been revealed through dialogue or visually. This is the main reason that, while a very strong achievement without question, this film does not quite rise to the level of Christopher Nolan\\'s \"Dunkirk,\" another visually immersive representation of a short time frame in a terrible 20th-century war. The time span of the film seems very slightly contrived as well.That said, this is probably the most unique and detailed portrait of World War I since \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" and I absolutely recommend it. 8/10NOTE: I saw an advance screening of the film in RPX (Regal\\'s premium large format.) While the picture and sound quality were good, I still feel that RPX is inferior to Dolby Cinema and IMAX.'},\n",

It will no doubt be remembered for its innovation and breathtaking cinematography.But while '1917' excels in the visuals category, I was left disappointed overall. The problem with creating such a visual feast is that people end up more interested in how the film looks rather than what actually happens it in. It felt like the plot was complementing the visuals a lot of the time rather than the other way round.While '1917' looks fantastic and is well acted and produced, the story failed to grip me, there wasn't enough character development, and there was a serious lack of emotion for a war film.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"War is a horrible act, there is no escaping that. Films have depicted that for a number of years, many making sure they capture the true horror of war for all to see. With 1917, Sam Mendes delivers a war film like nothing I've ever seen before, throwing the audience right on the frontline with a truly immersive experience.Two young British soldiers during the First World War are given an impossible mission: deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap.1917 is a feat of filmmaking within the war genre, filmed to look like one continuous take, and it may just be the best film from Sam Mendes yet. The long take can be quite gimmicky however, its use here aids the storytelling in such a way that you can't help but feel as if you're in the middle of the war yourself. You're there with the two young soldiers, whether it be cautiously crossing No Man's Land or running from enemy troops, up close and personal throughout, and it's just such a relentlessly thrilling film that left me breathless by the end.The camerawork in 1917 is utterly stunning, Roger Deakins proving once again just how much of a genius he really is. The closeness of it all lets us get to know just who these men are and what exactly is it they are fighting for, all while portraying just how suffocating war can be with some exhilarating yet anxiety inducing set-pieces. Accompany that with Thomas Newman's beautiful score and 1917 becomes an even more powerful beast, the soaring crescendo towards the end in particular hitting me with a wave of emotion.1917 may be technical marvel but it wouldn't be anything without the two lead performances, George MacKay in particular. Both he and Dean-Charles Chapman make this a story to really care about as they deliver performances of both bravery and fear, the latter making this quite a tough watch at times. Other than these two, 1917 is a who's who of major British talent making up the numbers, Mark Strong being the one I just know had to make an appearance.It's only January but I doubt many films will come close to topping 1917 in 2020, a true masterpiece that will no doubt be a future classic. I would certainly be happy with this walking away with Best Picture at the Academy Awards and for George MacKay to be getting a Best Actor nod for his great work here.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"War films were made in large numbers in the decades of 50s and 60s (mainly set in World War 2) were a staple for audience's along with Spy films. You had classics like Dirty Dozen, Guns of Navarone, Kelly's Heroes & Where the Eagles Dare and comedies like Operation Petticoat made during those period. Unfortunately audience's preferences declined and the only memorable war films since then were the ones like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk & Hacksaw Ridge according to my opinion. This year we got to see a mediocre yet entertaining Midway and a gem like 1917.Based on the events partly narrated by his grandfather, director Sam Mendes offer the greatest tribute to his grandfather with a gem like 1917. It describes the story two soldiers who have to deliver a message to their battalion in the enemy territory before they fall to enemy's trap.Some might find the pace of the film a bit slow but it effectively showcases the difficulties the two soldiers have to encounter in delivering the message. The director excels in showcasing the emotion of the two soldiers which was complimented by CGI free cinematography.All actors enacted their parts well and the direction of the film by Sam Mendes (A comeback of sorts after a mediocre Spectre and has added another gem into his kitty along with films like Road to Perdition and Skyfall) along with excellent cinematography by Roger Deakins.Hope this film earns the Academy Award for the Best Picture and make the genre of War films more relevant.(Rather than relying on big budgeted Franchise films the Hollywood studios should take an initiative in supporting more such films which will be appreciated by audiences)\"},\n",

Performances are effective: the relatively unknown leads bring sincerity and intensity to their roles, supported by a cast of veterans (Colin Firth, Mark Strong...) with short but memorable appearances.Technically, 1917 is a marvel: director Sam Mendes and legendary director of photography Roger Deakins really achieved something remarkable.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Though I feel a little like War films are going to struggle to find anything new to say, \"1917\" has a pedigree that meant I couldn\\'t let this one pass me by, and it\\'s such a technical marvel that I\\'m glad that I did.During The Great War, two soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are charged with crossing what was formally no mans land to locate a battalion that is planning to go over the top the following morning. Unbeknownst to the command team at this location, the German\\'s have withdrawn strategically and are setting a trap. Blake is particularly invested in this mission as his brother in part of the battalion due to attack.There was a great choice made to attempt to tell his story is a few cuts as possible, so, for example, the film opens with a good half an hour long scene of the soldiers receiving their orders, making their way along the trenches and across no man\\'s land. It\\'s here that you get a sense of the filmmaking scale, with miles of trenches being dug out and hundreds of extras giving a full impression of how awful conditions would have been for the real soldiers. You also see the skill of camera work, as it moves along the trenches with the guys, before sailing out and around them as they reach more open land.All that technical work though, shouldn\\'t over shadow the central performances from the leads. They\\'re excellent. Both convey that they are best friends, but that they are at different points in their war experience, with Blake more optimistic about heading home than Schofield. The key personnel in the military brass are all played by recognisable actors, Daniel Mays, Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch and though they\\'re little more than cameos they\\'re obviously dependable and they all do a good job.Admittedly, away from the strengths, it is another film that has the similar \"War is bad\" message and whilst that\\'s a message that\\'s often worth repeating, it\\'s not a new one. I would also be a little critical of the score, which felt heavy-handed in places - particularly around the ruined town.The positives far outweigh the negatives though for a film that must be the favourite for the Cinematography Oscar at least.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"In the same way that I'm dispositioned to despise anyone from Upper St. Clair or Mt. Lebanon - Pittsburgh-centric content, yinz guys - I'm also usually on high alert to dislike Oscar bait like this film. So let me get all my vitriol out of my system before it begins: for a movie that people are proclaiming as a human experience of war, all I could see were the technological advancements and filmmaking tricks that allowed for the continuous shot style of the first half of this movie.It's fine. It was up for the biggest prizes in movie making and yep. It's a fine movie. It has no real soul or reason for you to watch it more than once, but this may be more of an indictment of this reviewer than this film.It left me cold and I felt like I was begging it for warmth. Just a casual outline of the events of the movie seem like they could be moments worth viewing, such as the choice to save or murder the downed German pilot. Instead, they are just moments.Sam Mendes has had a wonderful run so far, between his highly regarded James Bond films, Jarhead, Road to Perdition and American Beauty. He has an eye for huge visuals and the ability to tell a great story. This isn't a small movie, despite really only centering on one character's experience in the war.I probably enjoyed the scenes with the drunken soldiers blessing Schofield and Blake before they ventured into No Man's Land more than anything else in the movie. Although I wonder what the narrative point is of the film, which informs us at the end that everything that the leads have endured was truly for nothing, as the orders will probably change in the next week. This is not the first movie I've watched recently that offered little to no hope. Or maybe that was just life itself.Again - I felt like this movie was an awesome technical achievement. Perhaps the self-congratulatory nature of Hollywood and the press put me off, as I didn't need to hear its creators sing its praises so much. Or perhaps a steady diet of Mexican, Phillipino, Hong Kong and Italian junk movies have eroded my movie watching abilities, only allowing me to savor movies where black-gloved madmen strangle women and gas-guzzling mutants rise from the grave.Probably. So what?\"},\n",

George MacKay is spectacular as Lance Corporal Schofield. Dean-Charles Chapman is outstanding as Lance Corporal Blake.

The scenes of the trenches, dead horses, bomb craters etc really put you in the scenes, and I was blown away by the film from a visual point of view.

(I'm about to reveal spoilers, so don't read on if you haven't seen it).\\nSo we all know that it's true that German forces retreated from trenches at times. As the distance between allied and opposing forces was as matter of yards in many cases, the fact they had abandoned their line would have been obvious over a relatively short period of time to the allies, because of air and recon intelligence.\\nWhen the rat triggered the trip wire, both men were literally on top of the trap. It was a big enough explosion to collapse the entire tunnel, but they both survived without a scratch.\\nAfter the pilot killed Blake, almost straight away, Schofield was suddenly joined by a huge troop of British Allies. Where did they come from? Why didn't they just take the message?\\nWhen they drop Schofield off, he immediately starts getting sniped, while the troops are presumably right next to him. Why didn't they shoot back to help? Where did they disappear to?\\nWhen Schofield is being chased, he kicks a door through in clear view of his pursuer, and the pursuer just runs on. Leaving Schofield to spend a random night with a woman and baby who happened to be surviving on their own with no food and water, hidden in the same ruins as German troops.\\nThere are more.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'When one hears a politician boasting of the armament that his country possesses, one claiming that he has the mother of weapons, the other the father, while some \"cockerels\" of the third world are also doing nearly the same, those who do not solve food and housing and in the end they end up offering slogans with death as an inescapable promise, it is because those presidents or supposed courageous men have never been in war. The film \"1917 (2019)\" of British director Sam Mendes, based on the stories of a family predecessor who had the misfortune to participate in World War I, is a clear example of the number of lives lost in a war, the pains that cause in the families of the fallen ones and the economic damages that it causes. This film reflects the damage with many details, one of them is the hatred among rival soldiers, to the point of assaulting when they are doing you a favor of life or death. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, both managed to attract all the attention of the public throughout the film and their performance was such that they looked like the same soldiers on the battlefield. They managed to bring reality to the big screen. There were no foolish scenes of those vulgar war movies that show non-existent supermen in those confrontations. It is a quality film, with a real plot, well-designed fiction, and excellent photography.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Sam Mendes has made a technically bravura film which looks like one long take. Something he experimented with at the beginning of his James Bond movie, Spectre.Made by Dreamworks, the company's first shot for the Best Picture Oscar was Saving Private Ryan in 1998.The story is about two soldiers in World War One. Their mission is to make their way across no man's land, the abandoned German lines and reach the advancing Allied troops. They have to deliver a message ordering them not to attack as they are walking into a trap set by the Germans who want to give the impression that they are retreating.One of the soldiers has good reason to take this perilous mission. His brother is part of the Allied group and is in danger. Therefore the story owes a nod to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.Impressively photographed by Roger Deakins, it sets out to show the dirty horrors of trench warfare. The story though is slight and gets lost with the style of filmmaking that Mendes has employed.I thought it lacked the verve of Peter Weir's Gallipoli, a film which I kept thinking off when I watched 1917. This might be the reason that although it went into the Oscars as a frontrunner, it lost out on the main prizes.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Sam Mendes in 1917 gives us his variation on the old adage, \"if you think you\\'re going through hell, keep going,\" and for all of the given technical prowess - and a 70 year old Roger Deakins showing with a big grin that he\\'s still got one of the most massive cinematography you-know-whats in the industry - I didn\\'t feel much while watching this, except the occasional \"oof\" or \"ugh\" (usually when seeing some of the first dead bodies and rats). It\\'s a conceptual piece that means to be a major statement on the horrors of war, and it only reminds me that the films about war that have stayed with me more than any are the ones that provide visceral and complicated characters FIRST, craft wizardry SECOND (or at least concurrently).I thought at some point I might compare it to how a war-like video game works (I dont have a lot of experience playing these sorts of first-person shooters, Im just going by assumption), and to Mendes\\'s credit he tries to slow things down here and there so it isnt all thrill-a-minute action and spectacle. But it does carry that sense of the mission these two are on and the sort of \"stuff\" that happens is more interesting than getting to know them (and when we briefly do, it\\'s unremarkable, maybe a sign of why Mendes doesn\\'t usually write his own films).It\\'s a somewhat precarious position to be in as one in the audience, since objectively I know what everyone on the crew did to make this come off, from the art direction to the props to how goddamn realistically-based the camera is (or I should say like 80% of the time), yet by the end it means to lay an emotional punch to the gullet, and I just didn\\'t connect.Maybe some will, or maybe some will be even more bothered by what is clearly, as far as elevator pitches go, an attempt to one-up Kubrick with Paths of Glory (I van almost hear Mendes in his head as he shoots this going, \"hah, take that and your trench tracking shots!\") via the near-one take approach of Rope. But, again, those films had scripts that were engaging completely on the scale of what horrors human beings do to one another on an individual scale, with the system as a cudgel, not to mention enormously moving performances (same with another film that did this far better, Birdnlman, for its theatricality). This is kind of a... Forced-Poetic idea of a tragic story, impeccably made but hollow at its heart.For all the impressive filmmaking brio on display, I unfortunately have a sinking feeling this may win best director and best picture at the Oscars not for exactly being a \"best\" but for being the \"most\" film (or trying to be). And as for it being an anxiety-filled experience... Folks, c\\'mon, Uncut Gems is in a theater right next door to this one at your local cineplex .'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"After seeing trailers and reading other reviews, I was determined to watch this new movie in cinema. And it did not disappoint a single bit; I was on the edge of my seat the whole film. Mendes creates an ultra-realistic piece of cinema by filming in what seems to be one shot and giving the viewer the feeling he is part of the protagonists mission. It's a two hour rollercoaster through the dirty trenches of France, with not a single moment to take a breath. A gift from the Gods for the movie enthusiast, but also a thrilling experience for even the strangers of cinema.It remembered me a lot of Dunkirk, with similar claustrophobic feelings, by showing not only the true horror of war but also the pure loneliness it brings with it. The fear to die alone, to become a forgotten name, to become a meaningless casualty in a meaningless war. The film is so realistic that it often feels you're watching a documentary. The cinematography is a pure pleasure for the eyes; the glowing mist in the French hills, every detail is right, every expression and action of the extra's are right; I could go on forever, but long story short; Oscar Winner for best film 2019. And just in time released to make it a contender for one of the best movies of the last decade, if not off all times. Trust me, I'm not exaggerating. It's a true masterpiece.I highly recommend to watch the Peter Jackson documentary 'They Shall Not Grow Old', which also gives a great insight in the First World War. A war that is often over shadowed by WWII. Not only by cinema, but also by general knowledge. Not many people actually know how horrible the dirty, muddy trench war was from 1914-1918.\\nA high praise for Mendes to bring this world changing event so realistically to life, something that happened more than hundred years ago, but should never ever be forgotten.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"1917\" It is a film, a film that transforms due to its applied technique, with a lint of script, the feature film directed by Sam Mendes conquers the viewer by its visual and technical direction, all simulated in a sequential plane and with a frightening sound mix, the claustrophobic and menacing film takes us on a journey that we will feel in our skin the linearity and terror of a war.The script is simple and clear, two cables have the mission of taking a message from one point to another, until the success of your object is dubious, because the journey here is worth more than the conclusion, the two cables, lived by the actors George Mackay and Dean-Charles are doing very well, although the film doesn\\'t leave much room for us to contemplate performances, George\\'s few moments of terror and anguish are great.In addition to a script that serves as an excuse to embark and enjoy a journey, the character developments are simple but profound, but the film puts itself at a pace where it is counterproductive to create depths, and when Sam Mendes does that, he is the only 5 minutes that we disconnected from the film.The technique of the film is the one that most stands out, simulating a sequential plan of a war movie seems very bold, when \"Birdman\" did it 5 years ago we were delighted, here, this feeling is even more elevated, care of technique that Sam Mendes had here is something to think about, it is clear that the sequential plans are simulated, we perceive their cuts, however, the long planes conducted are diverse and bold, although many of them are with little action on screen, their conduct is magnificent, with several open plans and a constant contemplation of the disaster, with mutilated bodies, rats and dirt, the disgust and fear is passed on to the viewer who accompanies that narrative stuck in the chair, much because of this narrative conduction and other fundamental aspects too, his composition of scenery, his photography that in certain moments blurs in order to create tension and darkens in planes with strong lighting that turns scenes into horror films, and last, but not least, the sound, everything that surrounds this important component of war film is great, starting with its mixing and ending with its magnificent soundtrack, the composer Thomas Newman abuses classical music and its equalization sound, always with high and progressive tones, in order to lead the viewer to the climax, as an element of horror film.\"1917\" is not a cinematic perfection, we have some errors of continuism (which are acceptable in a sequential plan), we also have a problem when the film uses special effects instead of practice, as such effects are very perceptible, even so \"1917 \"is a spectacular film, very similar to classics such as\" Saving Private Ryan \"and recent films like\" dunkirk \", whose immersion capacity is the same.Sam Mendes returns to be very prestigious 20 years after his classic \"American Beauty\" with an extremely technical film and who has everything, even in an extremely busy year to become the highlight of the Oscars and awards.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Im in shock of this masterpiece, im going to be honest, first when i saw that 1917 was nominated for many academy awards and it won the golden globes for best picture and best director i was a little bit confused cause i think that the director doesn\\'t deserve that, and i said to myself, is it that great?! I dont think its that great, its just a movie about a guy who wants to deliver a message to save 1600 of his fellow comrades. but after i watched this movie im proud to say that this movie is one of the best movies that i have ever seen in my whole life and its for sure on the list of my top 5 favorite movies.1917 is a movie that shows you every single thing that every single soldier used to go through during world war 1, really enjoyed every single thing about the movie from the music to the customs to the cinematography to scriptwriting. The movie shows us the disgusting stuff that they went through. This movie is so deep and emotional, 2 hours passed by so fast i didnt even feel it, i didnt even want the movie to come to an end. And i saved the best for the last, the fact that the movie is a \"one shot\" is just unbelievable, you are literally there In every single thing they are going through or doing, some people will say that its boring (because of the one shot), but the director wants you to be there in every single scene and every single detail thats why its a \"one shot\". A perfect movie that u have to watch in the big screen (Would be way better if its IMAX) unless you wont have the perfect experience. I wont be surprised if this movie wins many academy awards because it really deserves it. Hats off to all the cast & crew, Thank You for this masterpiece.'},\n",

There\\'re lots of world war movies out there and many are perfect though, but this one to me and for sure many others till now; was one of the best among all, this kind of non-stop narration that rarely the scenes seem to be changed like it doesn\\'t change at all and the process goes through the end from only one view( I don\\'t know if there\\'s an specific word for this kind or not) makes it a perfect movie that forces you to sit back and follow the story and feel like you\\'re the third person of the scene as a soul beside them and feel everything they do! Maybe others would say: \"oh! Come on, this is not all that!\" But it really is for me and the fans maybe.

While I have seen some great films in the past few years that I absolutely loved, nothing has felt quite as ecstatic as 1917 which is the best movie that I have experienced since Interstellar.The story depicts WWI but instead of focusing on a major battle, a monumental victory or some grand individual, it chooses to tell the tale of two simple soldiers tasked with delivering a crucial message. It was literally one day of their lives but because it happened during the war, every minute of that day felt like a harrowing experience. There aren't too many word being said and to be honest they are not needed because experiences such as those makenit hard to talk.One shot. Could you imagine a two hour war movie made of only 1 continuous shot? 1917 flows in a smooth motion and on the way it brings us along for the journey unlike any movie that I have seen before. When the bombs exploded the sound was deafening and when the leaves rustled, I could feel the breeze around me. As a history fan, I was pleased with the accuracy of both the decorations and the visible morale of the soldiers. There is a number of powerfully emotional sequences that felt like they were scraping my heart because of the constant proximity to the charaters.1917 is a perfect blend of storytelling, style and technical achievement and I give a deepest bow to Sam Mendes and the team for this symphony of cinema. What I loved is how a number of big name actors appear in this film for a few minutes and yet manage to make a lasting impact on both the protagonists and myself. There are no hidden meanings or forced agendas, just masterful filmmaking that must be experienced in the cinema.As much as I love Saving Private Ryan, this is my new favorite war movie of because it allowed me to feel as one of it's characters.#moviesshmovies\"},\n",

Some of the stories feel disconnected from each other and feel like filler.If you disregard the single shot style of the editing, the film would feel no different than Midway, for example. Midway was a big budget spectacle with no story and little dramatic elements and this one is too. I understand the attempt to move from heroism cliches but having no emotional investment in a war film is not a good idea.Aside from a couple of Mendes' trademarks like the truck scene (reminiscent of the Semper Fi scene of Jarhead) and night fire silhouettes (reminiscent of Skyfall), there is not much to grasp to.It also has a big segment that is so tonally different and disconnected from the film it makes you wonder why did they put it in (the sniper scene and the follow-up with the baby).1917 is a technical achievement with little to no essence.

So 1917 is directed by Sam Mendes , and I've been looking forward to this movie ever since the trailer dropped cause it's from the minds behind The war movie Jarhead which was also directed by Mendes and shot by frequent collaborator Roger Deakins. And I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I was blown away ! . The story is set amidst world war 1 and it's about these two soldiers who have to get through a lot of German territory and notify their camp to stop the planned attack for the next day. The journey to the camp is filmed to look like a one shot with no edits like how birdman was shot. And the man who shot it was Roger frickin Deakins , the man who shot the Shawshank Redemption , Blade runner 2049 and pretty much every movie which is worthy of being your desktop wallpaper , and this movie is no exception. The way it's shot makes you feel claustrophobic and also like you're watching a first person shooter game. The score by Thomas Newman was great and added a lot of weight to the story. The gripes I had with this movie was that you don't really care much for the characters cause you don't know much about them and since it's a warzone it's no surprise if anyone dies really, and the dialogue felt very bland in b/w convos , but I guess that's how people really talk at a time of crisis and quotable dialogue would've made it seem more fictional. In the end 1917 is more of an experience than a movie and to sum it up , it's the Revenant meets Dunkirk .\"},\n",

And for the critics who complain that there is no character building moment in the movie, it's because the motivation here is to save lives and not focus on characters. #1917 leaves you breathless, with an uplifting feeling (and some tears) when the journey comes to an end.\\nOnly to be seen on the big screen, preferably IMAX 2D.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is a new war drama directed, partly written and produced by Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty and Skyfall.The film is set during the First World War where the two British soldiers Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George Mackay) are sent on an important and dangerous mission. They must alert the British troops of 1,600 soldiers, among which Blake his brother before they attack and thus fall into a deadly hostile trap. The two must travel through friendly and enemy trenches for this mission, but also through the dreaded no man's land filled with war victims, damage and deadly booby traps.Director Sam Mendes, together with photography director Roger Deakins, visualized and edited the film in such a way that it appears as if the film was only shot in a long scene. This way of filming was also done by Alejandro G. Iñàrritu with his Oscar winning film Birdman. The cameras film the entire film around the characters. The various cameras are held by the hand for filming, on cars or via iron rods and wires concentrated on the characters. This way of filming makes it feel like you are also present as a third soldier as a viewer during this mission in the war. As a viewer, you also want to look around to see if you see any dangers such as barbed wire, bomb wires or mines. This creates extra excitement and intense moments, because just like the characters you are in unknown hostile territory. You also do not know that when you see others at a far distance, whether they are friendly or hostile soldiers. Because of the way they put this film together, they show how bad a war and its consequences are.The film location and the attributes on the film set also help well with the realistic transfer of the film. No man's land is filled with war victims, their animals, used ammunition and hidden booby traps. Because of the way they were filmed, they were also dependent on natural light and weather. Because of this, they needed more time when filming, because they had to wait until the sunlight was out or in the right place.The acting is done well by the two main players. As a viewer you do not know too much about them, but you still care about them and their important mission and hope that they do not get themselves in danger. Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are also not such well-known actors, but they still know how to deliver good and fitting acting in this film. Major actors such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Colin Firth play more smaller roles in this film, but they are important roles.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\\'1917\\' is a landmark in cinema history. Never before has WW1 been reconstructed and portrayed in such a terrifyingly honest and tender light from such an intimately human perspective. In fact, rarely have any films matched what Sam Mendes has achieved here.Continuous \\'one-shot\\' camera work places the viewer in a striking first-hand point of view. Gritty, bleak, historically accurate sets immerse you in the battlefield. Whether that\\'s in the haunted bones of a crumbling French town, seeing the pockmarking of cavernous craters, brushing shoulders with servicemen in cramped trenches, or pacing through the sheer accompanying volume of corpses, blood, mud, and dust. The imminence of death overshadows constantly.Mendes\\' focus on character development imprints a deep purpose for the events of the film; saving 1,600 men, including the brother of one of the main characters, from a looming German entrapment.The Germans have made a \"strategic withdrawal\", suggesting that they are on the run. In fact they\\'re lying in wait, armed and ready to repel the planned British push. It\\'s a race against time to deliver the message on foot to call off the push.George MacKay and Dean-Charles are perfectly cast as Schofield and Blake. Each character\\'s motivations are clear, at times shared, at times not. Mendes has developed above all believable, complex, and genuine human characters to colour the dark, dreary setting of the production. The outstanding score brings this to even greater heights.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"It is quite surprising to learn that if you actually look at the numbers, there are not many films made about WW1 and certainly not the trenches, anymore. It is long enough ago now that all living grandparents and great grandparents who had experience of it, even if only as a child or through their parents, are no longer with us. So, unlike the 2nd World War which still more firmly feels part of the cultural and political fabric, WW1 is now a true 'historical' event. So when 1917 was released I was actually looking forward to it as I thought the time was right for another really good film from the trenches. And this certainly did not disappoint, in fact it was impressive on all accounts. The technical proficiency is absolutely amazing - it is largely single take which means that you live and breathe the few hours of one soldiers life with him without being able to take a break or switch perspective for a moment, just like the soldier. The pace also marches along rapidly, backed by an incredible score by James Newton Howard. The final 20 minutes are some of the greatest in cinema history. I truly felt like I lived and experienced the trenches like no other film, fiction or documentary, has allowed me before. It was very emotionally affecting and makes one grateful and proud of all the sacrifices made for our freedoms, regardless of one's political and philosophical stances on war.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Considered one of the best films of 2019 and a serious Oscar contender, 1917 tells the story of two British soldiers in World War One who have to save 1,600 of their fellow soldiers by informing their commander of a German trap being laid for them. The stakes are raised by the fact that one of those 1,600 is the brother of one of the two messengers. 1917 is intense, tragic, and a pure adrenaline rush.The thing that has garnered the most attention with this movie is the fact that it gives the illusion of being done in two takes and it looks like it is happening in real time. The result of this is perfect immersion. When you see from this camera's angle, it feels like you're really there and that you're going to deliver the message with them. It raises the tension greatly, in a movie that is tense by the nature of its premise. The cinematography, editing (how did it not get this Oscar nom?), design of sets and props, and sound are perfect. From a technical standpoint, it is quite possibly the best film of 2019.Throughout the film, we see various aspects of the reality of WWI, and all of it seems very plausible in its presentation. We see life in the trenches at the beginning, a relatively calm place all things considered. We see the deathly hell of No Man's Land, complete with a plethora of partially decomposed corpses, humans and animals. We see what civilians had to go through in the scenes in Ecoust. We see a battle, but not exactly the heat of it. And it all ends calmly. All of these factors combine to make it seem very real. When you watch this movie, you feel like you are part of it. Director Sam Mendes has said that the inspiration for this movie was a story told by his grandfather about his experience in World War I. That being said, you can imagine this being an old man's story of war, how he and a dear friend went on a mission together, and it adds a layer of authenticity to it. 1917 is exhilarating, heart-wrenching, engaging. It is one of the best films of the decade and a worthy contender for Best Picture.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 (2019, Sam Mendes)\\nThis is a tough film to rate, and I will probably fall victim to being overly critical on this movie. In a vacuum it is a very good movie. It is well shot and acted very well although it does have that British sensibility which can sometimes seem a bit austere to an American audience. It tells an emotional, meaningful story set in war torn Europe following two young soldiers who are trying to move quickly through enemy occupied territory in order to bring a message calling off an attack that is doomed to fail. To add to the gravitas one of the two soldiers has a brother in the unit set to attack. This gives extra urgency to the film. The two lance corporals are played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay. Chapman is most easily recognized as his role as Tommen in the hit show 'Game of Thrones'. It is actually funny because Richard Madden makes an appearance later in the movie and he is also a 'Game of Thrones' alum. Maybe it is just that so many superlative war films have been produced or maybe it is because this feels very derivative combining many elements from a lot of those other war films, but whatever the case this film just didn't connect with me. Both actors did admirable jobs in their roles. The whole thing felt off to me. I didn't feel shock or horror at the violent carnage portrayed on screen. I didn't get emotional when tragic occurrences happened. The whole deliver a message plot seemed a bit like a contrivance. I know this was based, in part, on stories that Mendes grandfather imparted, but in a world of epic war stories this just didn't feel very epic, but at the same time despite just focusing on these two men who were traveling I never got a sense of intimacy either. It is directed well although I found the faux single shot more gimmicky than providing any meaningful improvement to the picture. The cinematography from legendary Roger Deakins is a thing of beauty. I think it is easy to lump this film into the best films of the year simply because it checks a lot of those boxes that we think those films are supposed to have, but I have just seen this film too many times told in just as good if not better ways for '1917' to get too much praise from me.\\nEric's Grade: B-\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'First of all, let me qualify my rating of a \"1\" as a counter response to this junk being considered as the \"frontrunner\" for Best Picture at the Oscars and ranked #51 currently on the top 250. It\\'s really about a \"6\"-\"7\", but many of the reviews and gushing that has occurred with this average movie are irritating and untruthful.Many years ago, a friend of mine got me to watch the movie \"Atonement\", which I had heard of but never saw before, and I was surprised a good portion of it had a lot to do with the WWI time period. Some of the more memorable scenes in that movie which made it stand out were based on events in WWI. While I didn\\'t love Atonement, I could at least see why it was nominated for Academy Awards because it was artistically written and filmed with several layers and themes that stuck with you, at least for a little while after watching it. Well, Atonement never won any major awards, despite the nominations, perhaps justly so as although it was a pretty good movie, it wasn\\'t all that.Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest WWI-II time period war movie ever made also did not win Best Picture at the Oscars. Both of these movies are at least twice as respectable and good as \"1917\", which except for the impressive one-take filming method, comes across often as implausible, dumb, banal, and believe it or not actually laughable at times with how ridiculous some of the scenes are. This movie actually borders on \"Commando\" territory with the main character\\'s plot armor, and that\\'s only one point of many with what is wrong with it.To even consider this movie in the same league as SPR is laughable in many ways. Even a movie I didn\\'t like too much like Atonement, at least it had some depth and an actual script with character development. This war movie, 1917, has practically nothing except for the one-take clever achievement.It actually \"tries\" to add depth, but it fails when it zeroes in on implausible and cheesy scenarios with the milk-baby scene, the Indian winding up in the back of the truck just for PC-oriented people, and a superficial yet disappointing attempt at tying in themes of family and moral dilemma, especially during the final act. The way it handles these attempts at depth truly comes across in a manner in which it seems like the \"target audience\" of this movie is Marvel comic book fans and teenagers. The visuals are great, but it has basically no depth at all. It cheesily places good actors in \"cameo\" roles, when their acting gravitas should have been used in major roles somehow to add credibility to it, instead.I just can\\'t believe the Academy might stoop so low as to hand this Best Pic when it really has a weak script and writing. It would only validate the fact that the quality of movies Hollywood has been producing the past decade or two has fallen officially so far as to reward borderline-Marvel-comic book films that play out like video games for teens as its Best Picture.'},\n",

Especially the first 35 minutes of the movie, because it really shows how gritty, ugly and atrocious war is. And the way that whole part of the movie was set up was just amazing.Then the next 25 minutes, the movie started to gear down, as the two characters were trekking about. Sure, it was still enjoyable. Then the last hour of the movie it just fell into mediocrity, and the movie never got out of that slump. And it was a shame, because it was off to such a marvelous start.This movie is no \"Saving Private Ryan\", although there are similarities, for sure. But they are two very different movies, both in story and entertainment value.I watched the movie, and was adequately entertained, however, I can\\'t say that this is a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time around, because the movie just didn\\'t have that much to offer. And those glorious 35 minutes in the start of the movie just didn\\'t stretch to salvage the rest of the movie.It should be said that the acting in the movie was adequate. Sure, this is not a movie that is heavy of thespian acting performances, but the people were doing good enough jobs with their given roles. But I really don\\'t think that anyone were given any proper chance to shine and stand out in throughout the course of the movie.Visually, then \"1917\" was good. It was a dirty and gritty movie, definitely making it feel like an authentic WW1 movie, and it did feel like you were right there in the muck with the soldiers.My rating for the movie was initially going to be a 6 out of 10 stars, but because of the sliding down into mediocrity, then the movie settles on a 5 out of 10 stars from me. While it is watchable and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be, it was by no means a milestone in war story cinema.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'And that\\'s the last good thing I will say about this film besides the obvious fact that the production value is amazing.1917 fails to deliver an intriguing story, instead providing us with a generic \"time is running out\" plot line. The two characters we follow throughout the film aren\\'t even that interesting, because we know nothing about them. Sure one of them has a brother, but Mendes did not make it easy for me to get invested with the character\\'s journey. There was not much tension from the characters. Instead the tension came from Deakens\\' bleak cinematography and Newman\\'s intense score. I did not feel much for the characters. Mendes expects you to care because it\\'s war, and not actually because he made fascinating people. So at the end of the film, there is no satisfaction that the goal was achieved. 1917 has a characterization problem. If I cared more about the characters, I would be a lot happier. But instead, all the struggles they went through didn\\'t feel that rewarding. Additionally, there were no strong supporting roles either. Every person that wasn\\'t our main duo felt like a cameo. I shouldn\\'t expect to love them or even know everything about them, but when a commander is on-screen, I should feel the gravitas of his information.Overall not a great film but definitely technically solid.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'The first thing anybody will tell you about \"1917\" is that it was filmed to look like one long take. It\\'s the kind of movie that uses \"making of\" featurettes as part of its marketing strategy. Unless you really dig movies that are technically accomplished but not much else, beware. Remember \"The Revenant?\" Remember how whenever anyone involved with that movie talked about it in public all they talked about was how grueling it was to film? They didn\\'t talk about the characters, or the story, or the themes, or the emotional investment. No, it was just a bunch of logistics about how to work in the cold.Yes, \"1917\" is a technical marvel, and I would probably recommend it just so that people can see it for themselves, as I\\'m sure a lot of people will be dazzled enough by it that they won\\'t care that the gimmick came first and the story came later. My problem is that, for a movie that\\'s supposed to make us feel what it\\'s like to be dumped into the chaos of war, it feels so overly choreographed. The film never stops being impressed with itself, and as the camera tracks and swoops and swirls around perfectly art directed WWI battlefields, you can practically hear Sam Mendes cooing \"wait till they get a load of THIS shot.\" I was so distracted by watching the gimmick that I never felt involved in the story.But maybe that\\'s for the best, since there isn\\'t much of a story to be invested in. Mendes went to the Steven Spielberg school of directing, where character motivations are so simplistic that a five year old could understand them. Thomas Newman provides a typically thunderous score that telegraphs every time it comes blaring on the screen exactly how we\\'re supposed to feel, which can pretty much be summed up as \"War Bad. Heroes Good.\" Roger Deakins, who deserves every ounce of praise he\\'s sure to get for this movie, does create some beautiful and astonishing images, but the one-shot approach gets monotonous after a while and draws attention to what a contribution skillful editing would have made to the film\\'s rhythms.One thing that surprises me somewhat is that among all the awards buzz this film is generating, none of it has been for lead actor George MacKay, who delivers a stunning and stunningly physical performance. Because the whole movie is designed to look like one continuous shot, he is by definition in literally every moment of it, and he totally carries it. If Leo DiCaprio could win an Oscar for grunting and grimacing his way through \"The Revenant,\" why shouldn\\'t MacKay be recognized for this?Grade: B+'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is nothing short of a technical masterclass and I'm really glad I got to see it before the Oscars. Roger Deakins cinematography mixed with an excellent score and terrific acting easily makes it one of the big fishes of 2019. Sam Mendes helming direction yet again proving why he is one of the best man still working.The movie has tons of big names but in very small roles and its totally fine. The relative newcomers Dean Chapman and George Mckay were truly show stealers. This could've easily been a war movie with just great visuals, instead it is a war movie with fantastic acting and a simplified plot. The plot is basically conveying a message to a battalion to stop the march. But what it lacks in plot depth it makes up with its luscious screenplay and extremely fitting sets and settings. The bleak visuals, a gloomy patch of grey and straw all builds the already neck high tension and keeps alleviating it.The suspense is just too much at times, the characters do get breaks but when it gets serious its almost heartpounding. The deafening score highly contributes to the increasing tension and it doesn't shy away from occasional surprises. I do have to say a few words about how it was shot. It was sort of edited to be one shot and although at times it doesn't add anything to the storytelling and strains your eye on the constant panning, it does infact grow on you and get you hooked in no time. Truly marvelous editing right there.All in all 1917 can and should easily grab a few of the Oscars and definitely make things a lot harder for the other nominees, that should be enough reason to give it a try before making your prediction list.RATING: 9/10\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'No wonder 1917 is getting awards by the truckloads- it is a fine war movie. Not only because it makes you abhor war, like every good war movie does. Also because it is without being overtly gritty, a very realistic portrayal of those lowest in the pecking order- the infantry-man. And also for the fact that technically- it is a marvel.It is also a very different kind of war movie. Thank god to the title, it did not need a prologue, or any character build up. We straightaway jump into the odd mix of silence and mayhem that trench warfare was in the First World War. We learn that the Germans have made a strategic withdrawal and are waiting to pounce on unsuspecting British forces chasing them, with the obvious mcguffin being telegram wires cut. The task of stopping the pursuing British forces from attacking the artillery reinforced Germans falls upon two Lance Corporals- Blake and Schofield, and they literally have to go through hell to succeed. Shades of another war epic from Spielberg I say, along with some inspiration from Tolkien of course.\"They\\'re walking into a trap. Your orders are to deliver a message calling off tomorrow morning\\'s attack. If you fail, it will be a massacre\"The plot is based on a true story told by director Sam Mendes\\' grandfather. And Mendes goes all in to make 1917 an experience like no other. For people unfamiliar with WW1, a large part of the war was fought through two opposing trenches- the land between them known as No Man\\'s land. Last time we saw No Man\\'s land in a big budget mainstream release, it was Wonder Woman\\'s launch pad. Grim, but still comicky. In 1917, the opening tracking shot has to be admired not only for the authenticity of the sets, but also the way Mendes is able to show change in attitude and morale of the soldiers as we get closer to the trench frontline. No man\\'s land is hell itself though- dead horses with files buzzing around, dead soldiers hung up on fences or caked in the mud, craters that much rather be euphemistically called death pits, prowling aircraft waiting to machine gun stragglers, and the rats that are constantly feasting on still festering bodies- there is death everywhere even if the enemy has long left.\"You are in no man\\'s land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but remains forever, icy and silent.\"Blake and Schofield somehow make it through initially because they have each other. The loss of Blake at midpoint in addition to what he has already experienced strengthens Schofield\\'s resolve further as he is on a race against time. And all throughout there are scenes that pay homage to past war classics- the encounter with a German sniper is reminiscent of Enemy at The Gates, the touching moment with the baby calls out to Ayer\\'s 2014 tank classic -Fury, while the knife battle in the shadows again doffs its hat to Saving Private Ryan. It is to Mendes\\' credit that he makes Schofield\\'s Frodo like journey believable till the end, even as he put his life one final time by sprinting through the battlefield to prevent the homicide.The two main leads do not have come with loads of experience, but they do an excellent job. Pity that the script did not allow for a Game of Thrones reunion. In fact this is perhaps the only film in 2019 where everything comes together in a perfect symphony- music, cinematography, realistic sets, CGI, acting and the script.The list of Oscar nominations for 1917 is a testament- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Visual Effects. The best part is that unlike Joker, this is no award baiting movie. This just has a honest story to tell, and Mendes tells that with honesty and style, and that is why it is my pick for all the awards it has got nominated for.This is a mesmerizing movie. Technically brilliant, and shot in a way that kind of immerses the viewer the way Dunkirk never could. Sorry Nolan.Here is a bet- watch the movie, and if you are not running in your mind as Schofield makes his final dash, I will pay for your ticket.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Despite being an year stacked with amazing movies, none of them managed to touch me as emotionally as this movie did. Directed magnificently by Sam Mendes, 1917 engrosses you and keeps you at the edge of your seats from the very beginning as the tense atmosphere and a constant sense of danger are maintained throughout the movie. The characters are not portrayed as invincible heroes but as regular young men who are trapped in this situation, fighting a pointless war. The character development for the two main leads was done subtly but very effectively, with limited exposition. The performances by George Mackay and Dean Charles Chapman were top-notch and makes us really empathize with their characters. The cinematography by Roger Deakins was nothing short of breathtaking. The one-shot technique makes the experience much more immersive as we feel as if we are present there along with the characters. The score by Thomas Newman was phenomenal and helped to elevate the impact of several scenes. Another noteworthy aspect of the movie was its incredible production design, particularly the battlefield and the abandoned town, which showcases some of the most impressive set constructions of the year. The sound design was outstanding and further helped to convey the intensity of the situation.The focus is less on the battle and more on the suffering, destruction and loss caused by war. The soldiers in the movie themselves comment on the pointless and destructive nature of war. The incredible screenplay, direction and performances manage to present this theme in an emotionally impactful manner'},\n",

Some reviewers make it sound like 1917 is simply a technical triumph that is light on plot poignancy, but that diminishes the humanity that this movie represents. You feel like you are a part of the trenches. When a certain bomb goes off about 1/3 of the way through the movie, you live and breathe that moment in a way that 99% of movies could only ever hope to achieve.This is a powerful movie.

If the message doesn't reach them, 1600 men are going to die. It's going to be a near impossible task for the two young men, but nevertheless they dare to cross the enemy line.Frankly, Sam Mendes' 1917 is a big disappointment. It looks amazing, that much is true, but everything else is severely lacking. Yes, the camera by the always amazing Roger Deakins is a highlight: The scope is unbelievably wide, yet it feels like Deakins is teasing and daring the audience to look beyond the movie screen. Fantastic stuff! But visuals alone don't make a movie.There's rarely a theme in 1917 that feels fresh and daring. It's a textbook war movie: There's a tragic death, a big shootout and a forced moment of tenderness and love. It's so predictable it's almost painful. The set piece at the end is truly breathtaking, but the ending itself is downright sappy.At the end of the day, 1917 doesn't bring many new ideas to the table. It tries to wow the audience with grandiose landscapes, but the two soldiers and their quest keep strangely one-dimensional.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I am grateful that one of my Grandma\\'s friends recommended that we see 1917. All I knew about the movie was that it was a war movie, it has lots of critical praise, and that it was nominated for Best Picture. After seeing the movie, let me tell you that all this hype is well earned.While 1917 is set in World War 1, it reminded me of a classic World War 2 movie-Saving Private Ryan. Both films are about the horrors of war and a dangerous mission to find the brother of another soldier. 1917 has another plot point as well though, where 2 soldiers are going to enemy territory to offer peace and stop a battle that will have deadly results if pursued.1917 succeeds most with the emotion, and that\\'s what carries most of the movie. For example, one of the 2 soldiers is stabbed and then dies in the other\\'s arms before he can get proper help. This is very emotional, especially since the viewer can connect with the bond that they have. Any death, whether from an enemy or not, is felt by the viewer.Speaking of the deaths, the violence is very effective as is necessary, of course. I especially appreciated that the gore was shown but not as graphic as Saving Private Ryan. Simply put, it shows enough war violence to stun the audience but not be too depressing.1917 is also effective with jump scares. Yes, there are jump scares, but not in a lame horror-film way. These are jump scares done right and well deserved. A character may be walking around and then without warning...BOOM! A gun is shot or a grenade is thrown.The movie also has great cinematography, as other reviewers have said-this should be considered to be among the best camera work of any film this year.Another great film-making aspect is that it has a \"one shot\" feel that makes the movie look to have one continuous shot, not broken up into different angles(The Oscar winner Birdman was filmed this way as well).1917 also does a great job of taking us to the year. That is, it really feels like it\\'s 1917 now, even though it was 103 years ago.While I have not seen any other of the nominees for Best Picture, I agree that this deserved one. I have minor flaws with it, but they don\\'t affect the movie\\'s overall high quality.This ranks with American Beauty, Road To Perdition, and Revolutionary Road as one of Sam Mendes\\'s best movies, and is well worth the time to see, so please do so!Note: After the movie ended, I asked my Grandma what she would rate it, and she said a 9.5 or a 10. I was shocked, as she hardly ever gives 10s. This got me asking what other movies she would rate a 10, to which she listed Hidden Figures, My Fair Lady, Titanic, Mary Poppins, among others.Since this is the case, that is 2 10/10s for you to base your decision on to see this movie. I hope you choose to see it, 1917 is a rewarding experience!*If you enjoyed this review, please click on cinephile-27690 for more. Movies are my passion so allow me to share it with you. I know I am a bit amateurish, but I hope I am improving over time! Thank you for reading this and any other review!'},\n",

The whole film seamlessly transitions from one area to the next looking like one extended shot, apart from one prolonged cut a little over half way through. The camera soars and dips, making circles around the action, following the soldiers through the trenches and swerving around walls. It\\'s an exceptional piece of cinema that immerses you in the picture, never feeling like a cheap gimmick.Apart from this, it\\'s just a damn good war movie full of emotion and not shying away from the horrors of war. People die. People are wounded. As a Lieutenant sarcastically remarks early on, \"Nothing like a scrap of ribbon to cheer up a widow.\" We experience a fragment of the war with our main characters, carried by a stand out performance by George MacKay. We feel what he\\'s feeling and feel immense sympathy for him throughout. As well as MacKay, Richard Madden takes over the screen in his brief appearance.Sam Mendes manages to craft scenes so tense and full of suspense (aided by a terrific score) that they wouldn\\'t feel out of place in a great horror movie and it fits the tone perfectly. In the middle of all of this, there are also scenes of beauty that show humans at their best. A group of people pushing a car out of the mud may seem relatively insignificant but it leaves a lasting impression. There\\'s also a wonderful scene between MacKay and a French woman. 1917 is a film that\\'s both haunting and poignant while being expertly crafted.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This movie is an excellent watch: brilliant set design, incredible acting all around as well as an amazing soundtrack that fit the events of the film perfectly. I also really liked the writing which delivered humorous banter and the sharing of funny stories amongst the young men sent to fight in a horrific war. I felt like it reinforced the idea that these soldiers are so close to each other that they're like children at school: constantly mocking one another and telling their own funny anecdotes. Another aspect of this film that was incredible was the atmosphere. Grimy and haunting environments (for instance, No Man's Land laden with corpses, rats and a miserable grey and cloudy sky) with eerie music was just a perfect combination.I'd say the only negative I have with this film is that it was hard to understand what some of the actors were saying at times. But other than that, I don't think I really have any other negative things to say about it. So to conclude, I absolutely recommend 1917, you'll be captivated as well as shocked (in a good way) it's a well deserved 9/10 from me ;).\"},\n",

In the case if user ratings for this film, currently at 8.5, the overall rating is 1.5 points too low! This is simply a cinematic masterpiece, period. No movie in history has ever been filmed as if in one long, uncut scene! Genius and ground-breaking film making. Breathtaking cinematography. Grit and beauty and reality of war, through the lens of the Director's personal knowledge passed from his own grandfather. Tear-jerking, heart-wrenching, pulsating tension, individuals persevering through an ever changing and huge landscape of war and the unknown - this is an epic brilliantly made for the big screen experience - bold yet nuanced. There was no better film released in 2019, and the fact that overall IMDB rating is anything less than 10 can only speak on behalf of those persons rating this film who have not closely followed and watched films from the silents to today, evaluating story first and foremost, then in close conjunction with directing, acting, cinematography, sets and sound. This movie is exquisitely detailed in every aspect of story-telling and film making. Thank you, Sam Mendes!\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'When I write this review, this movie had already 1.323 reviews, wow this is amazing response! But I hope my review is still useful for Sam Mendes loyal watchers. This movie had one long shot with one story only, but this is masterpiece. I would like directly say that Sam Mendes created story of a short journey of a English soldier, who represents the history of WW I itself. On the movie, you can see the trenches during World War I, the problem of being soldier, the ambiance of war, and the most important thing is that how from the beginning of the scene, the audiences can follow the journey of a soldier like they experience it by themselves. That soldier was supposed to give important message to other regiment, but on the journey there are many circumstances and events that he cannot deny. As an audience, I still remember all the scenes in one united story, and this is Sam Mendes expertise to make all scenes united in one single shot camera. Thank you also for camera crews that make this idea happen and perhaps become trend of scene language in the next 10 years in movie industry, especially war movies. This movie had lightened my day and although it receives some negative critics, I just do care about what is improvement for war movies. Sam Mendes had casting several figures that all have experiences in war movies and I think this wipes all the doubters. I mean, there are Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong, and Ralph Fiennes. Thank you for this movie, Sam Mendes!'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'April, 1917 in France, British Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George Mackey) are ordered by the General to go to an isolated regiment to order them to stop their invasion because it is a trap as the Germans are lying in wait for them. Telephone lines have been cut so soldiers need to be sent. Corporal Blake has more of an incentive to make the trip because his brother Joseph is in that regiment of 1600.This is a very long movie, but the pacing is on target and there is one big surprise along the way and that was a shocker for me.For the most part we see Blake and Schofield cross into tree-less enemy territory littered with dead horses, dead bodies, mud, rats, broken tanks and guns, barbed wire and barricades; and they also had to keep watch for German strafing planes. There were many, many trenches and I felt I was going thru them with Blake and Schofield. They also entered abandoned German trenches that were booby trappedThe camera work was seamless watching Blake and Schofield go thru what seemed like miles of trenches loaded with sand bags, and heavy planks. The photography and cinematography were spot on. Suspense and tension crept in from time to time. The music was haunting at times.Notables: Mark Strong as Capt Smith who told Schofield to have witnesses when he tells Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) to stop the invasion because he likes to fight; Richard Madden as Lt Joseph Blake; Colin Firth as General Erinmore who from his desk wished Blake and Schofield good luck on their mission. The entire cast of mostly no-name professionals performed exceedingly well.This is a movie that finally gave overlong tribute to WW1soldiers.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This movie certainly lives up to the hype and expectation given by the fact that they won the award for best drama at the Golden Globes last year. However, to say that this movie is better than Joker is well, I don't buy that as Joker has a better narrative and cinematography, but that is just my opinion. Firstly, I would like to make things clear that this is a movie about the humane side of war and the emotional toll it has on those involved within these wars and at its core, the human spirit to survive.The actor that absolutely stood out to me within this film is definitely George Mackay whom I have never heard of or have ever seen him in many major films before this and it is quite shocking to say that as he is indeed a talented actor whom in my opinion, if not for his acting capabilities, this entire movie would fall apart as this movie is more of a character driven movie rather than one that relies heavily on the movie's narrative. He manages to convey his character's emotions through his body language and all credit to director Sam Mendes too whom chose to direct a movie that requires the audience to observe and pay attention to the character's rather than having the character announce his emotions as seen in various movies these days. For me personally, the stand out scene would be the scene involving George Mackay's character in an army truck and it is truly such a powerful and emotional scene.Speaking of characters, I felt the use of cameos from major stars such as Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth and etc unnecessary as scenes with them last for approximately a minute or two and these scenes sort of stand out like a sore thumb in the movie as you know that it's just a cameo and these major stars are there for the sake of being there to provide the movie some extra dressing. Some may love this but I felt that these scenes were unnecessary and these actors could've been put to better use.As for the most talked about point regarding this movie, this movie is edited in such a way that makes it seem like a one-shot. The entire experience was amazing and it draws you into the brutal minute-by-minute environment of war; from the casual conversations between soldiers to the nasty action sequences. I was wondering if all the events would take place within the movie's 2 hour runtime but they managed to pull off the passage of time absolutely brilliantly without having to break the one-shot effect they were really gunning for.The cinematography was absolutely brilliant too, my gosh, this is a beautiful movie. I kid you not, each frame of this movie can be a screensaver and it is indeed an awe dropping experience. From the colour gradient used which is generally a sort of dull colour to depict the gritty environment of the battlefield to a beautiful flame within what is a dull environment (Not too experienced when it comes to colour gradients so this is the best I can do to explain it, sorry).As previously mentioned, I now shall comment upon the movie's narrative. Well, it isn't anything new to be honest which is where I feel the movie severely lacks as the end goal is certain and you can kind of guess how the movie is going to turn out regardless of the movie's emphasis on the race against time to deliver the message. Furthermore, I did not feel much tension during the movie as I hoped I would and this is mainly due to yet again, the predictability of the movie's endgame.Generally, at the end of the day, this is w a must watch. It may not be my pick for the Golden Globe award but my gosh, this is truly a cinematic experience you should not miss out on. Besides, it's January, all the movies out now can be missed out on and you probably wouldn't regret missing it; but this, this you cannot miss.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"From the first trailer, 1917 mesmerized me in a way few movies have. My husband and I waited with almost comical anticipation to see this in the theater; both of us are lovers of history and find World War I to be terribly undervalued in modern media. After having just come back from the theater, I am left shaken and utterly moved by the experience.1917 follows two British soldiers who must deliver a message by crossing perilous ground to save not only one of their brothers, but 1600 men walking into a trap while under the impression the war is nearly won. Never before have I seen a war movie so effectively grounded and clinging to the perspective of the leads; this first-person perspective delivers a brutal raw, gritty, personal feel that I wish more movies would emulate. This intimate perspective is aided by continuous shot film-making; while the movie is not, indeed, one shot, the majority of it certainly feels so, keeping us gripping on to the task at hand with merciless abandon as if the viewer is the one delivering the message. The majestic yet dark tone of war is consistent, gripping, and enthralling. Often we are taken through the post-apocalyptic feel of a ruined battlefield; the camera passes over masterfully placed corpses of both man and beast without much thought to linger, giving the lives lost just as much attention as the shells, shots, and foes that snuffed them out. It is utterly devastating and depressingly gorgeous, and that's not even touching upon the battlefield scenes at night, where the moving lights of flares and fire kiss the wasteland of mud and stone with such grace I was brought to tears.As someone who rarely cries even when a person close to me has passed, I am somewhat embarrassed to say 1917 brought me to tears three times, unlike any movie which came before it. It's not an intentionally heartstrings-tugging movie; however, as a lover of history, this absolute love letter of a film filled me with such wonderment I was left feeling a sense of awe and overwhelming sympathy for the men who were once asked to do unspeakable crimes and heroic actions for their fellow men. The two leads here are interesting and likable, though they are just developed enough so that it feels like they could be anyone's child, lover, brother, or father. In this way, 1917 manages to be both deeply intimate and all-encompassing, succeeding at an immensely difficult task that few other war movies--if any--have accomplished before it.Rarely have I watched a movie that has affected me to this extent. I will be thinking about 1917 and its lasting impact for years to come.\"},\n",

More focus is put on the human side of things which was very refreshing, especially considering how well acted each character is.Although the plot may disappoint some, I thought it was brilliantly paced and plenty happened. Regardless of the content, the production deserves recognition for what was achieved here.The 'single take' technique flowed much more smoothly than expected and the amount of effort required to get certain long takes spot on must have been immense. I expected to find it a little jarring or too intense, however the subtle cuts they made helped a great deal.I was also impressed with the representation of Sikh soldiers as I feel they are so rarely shown in films or documentaries for the part they played in the war. Granted there are only a few scenes and a couple of lines but nevertheless I was happy to see some inclusion.The cinematography and set design deserve special recognition, again regardless of the plot itself what the production team did with 1917 is nothing short of genuis. I highly recommend watching a behind the scenes video for this film, seeing the scale of the sets built is mind blowing.Doubt it'll win best picture but it certainly deserves at least a few Oscars given the amount of work put into making it.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '1917 is very intense, pretty much nonstop action. It has elements of Private Ryan with very realistic and horrifying special effects during the battle sequences, as well it has the \"First person\" POV (Point of View) made popular in such recent films as \"Dunkirk\" (as well as many video games).There\\'s a bit more to the story than it seems at first, as the desire to fulfill the \"Mission\" becomes an all-consuming drive for both the protagonist and the audience. It drives hard to the finish and never stops making the point as so many have pointed out in history: \"War is hell\".We gave it a 9/10 and feel it is a likely contender for several Oscars.To address the silly critics who say that it \"Looks like a video game\". Silly people - video games were given the \"First person\" POV so they could simulate REAL war! If you\\'ve not been in combat, you might not know that, but don\\'t pretend you know something when you don\\'t!Other critics I\\'ve seen have said \"There\\'s so little character development\". My goodness! Do you want to double the length of the film and see his birth and childhood too? It\\'s not necessary for the plot of the movie. The movie presents us with REALISM and ACTION, as well as the fact that in war, there\\'s no time to grieve, you simply gotta keep moving, or you\\'re dead.Even if you do keep moving, you may wind up dead. Ask the guys who stormed the beaches of Normandy, they\\'ll tell you: \"The guy on my left was killed. The guy on my right was killed. I didn\\'t get a scratch.\" That\\'s called \"Survivor\\'s guilt\" and is quite common.This movie grips you, and puts you in the trenches with the men who were there.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I read a headline critical of 1917 right before I saw it, that said something along the lines of 'Does 1917 have anything new to say about war?' I couldn't help but think about this throughout my viewing of the film, and realised pretty early on that no, perhaps it doesn't really have anything 'new' to say.But at the same time, what is there to say about war that hasn't already been said? The personal and psychological experience of the solider, following orders and just trying to survive, is a surprisingly universal one, and has been captured extremely well in many of the past few decades' best war films, including Platoon, Come And See, The Deer Hunter, and Full Metal Jacket. The broader issues of war, breaking it down politically and socially, looking at why nations fight and to what extent they are or are not justified in doing so, and the way things so often spiral out of control are all far more complicated topics to tackle, but someone like Ken Burns has more or less made a career out of doing that through his lengthy documentary miniseries.' So even in that department, it's hard to explicitly say something truly new and unique about the topic of war.This is all preamble to say ultimately it didn't matter to me that 1917 did not have a lot to say beyond how terrible war is, how foolish the higher-ups sending young men off to die are, and how brave some of the individual soldiers on the frontline were for surviving and trying to hold onto their humanity in the process. What 1917 does bring to the table is a new way of putting the audience into the war, capturing the tedium, tension, and horror of what our two main characters go through, largely through the immersive use of numerous long takes strung together to give the illusion of one single, continuous shot.It could be something of a gimmick to some, and I was skeptical in the film's first few scenes just how well this approach would work, but early on, when the camera follows our two main characters crossing No Man's Land, forcing us to experience every painful, tension-filled step along with them, no cuts to ease the tension by showing them suddenly safe and on the other side, I was basically hooked.To give away anymore of the set pieces I feel would be criminal. But even with the scenes in which danger isn't 100% present- the 'downtime' if you will- are often just as engaging and interesting, thanks to a powerful score, consistently great visuals, and two strong lead performances (plus a whole host of recognisable actors popping up in cameos, that honestly weren't too distracting).Very occasionally the writing veered close to being cheesy, and there were a couple of shots involving one character jumping that looked out of place- I think he was composited onto a green screen or CGI was used, because a couple of these stunts didn't look seamless. But these are ultimately nitpicks. By and large, this film as a whole works thrillingly and surprisingly well, and is entirely worth seeing on the big screen.There are images and sequences here that will stick with me for a long time to come. It's not quite my absolute personal favourite of 2019, but if it ends up taking home Best Picture, it'll be deserved.\"},\n",

A 2 hour non stop thrill ride, with few tension release moments.At the bridge scene, I just could not take it anymore. My heart could not stop pounding. My BP went up the sky. This felt so real. I went home. I needed a little bag to breathe. My wife called the doctor. They sent an ambulance!! I could not fight in a war. I know that, because I was in one yesterday. And I felt like almost dying of the tension alone.How real does a movie experience has to be? I saw my first movie in 1983, in a small theater in a small village, I think it was Banana Joe. We still had the afternoon matinees which starred Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. Dirty dancing and Moonwalker were big hits. Yes Moonwalker. We can hate this movie all we want now, but a lot of kids liked this movie, back in the time. It all changed with my first war movie: Hamburger hill , then came born on the fourth of july (yes in that order, some movies were screened late) Platoon and of course Full metal jacket. Which I found difficult to watch. And still feels very real. Especially the first part. I saw Apocalypse now some 10 years later... on a small screen...then came Saving private Ryan and so forth. But this is the first time I had to call an ambulance. I wanted to see the remaining 45 min.

Two guys are sent on foot across miles of no man's land with a life-or-death message which could, perhaps, have been dropped from an aircraft, or sent by semaphore, or delivered by actual runners, or taken part-way in one of the many vehicles encountered on the roads going the same direction, or even delivered on one of the hundreds of thousands of horses in the British Army. The Germans have removed everything from their trenches, except a few cans of food and their valuable guns, which, for some reason were right at the front line and have been destroyed. Meanwhile an entire battalion or more is happily waiting around for over a day without communication with HQ, and about to attack the enemy lines without artillery support or confirmation that nothing has changed since the day before. A man falls into some white-water rapids in the middle of flat open farmland, which just happen to wash him up exactly where he needs to be, but he gets there a few minutes late, which was about the amount of time he decided to spend trying to teach a French/Belgian baby an English song, whereas a few hours before he was trying, single handed, to push a 5 tonne truck in the mud because every second counted. Good to watch, just don't think too much about the silly plot.\"},\n",

First of all i love that the actors are 'real' i mean let's be realistic no one has the Rock as father, or Zac Effron at your school. The George Mackay is doing an AMAZING job. Like really full props to him, as wel as Dean-Charles. The movie is unique because it has just a few cuts in it. Like literally only three. You really get the pov but like as third person if that makes any sense. You get to see the realness of the character and really get a feeling of how things went down in WWI. And then we're not even talking about the music because oh my god, the music is outstanding. The violins really give you the full blown away feeling, maybe that's because i watched it in the cinema but i'm sure that with good headphones you'll get the same effect. Because the entire movie is almost one take you're really getting into the feelings of the character. You know just as much as the character. Nothing more nothing less. It was also a really good twist that Chapman died, i would've suspected that Scho would've died because he wasn't really in the spotlight at the beginning anyways. Really a good war movie and i would definitely watch it again! I btw saw this movie three times in the cinema so there's that\"},\n",

I was going into this movie expecting something that rivals the likes of Saving PVT Ryan, Platoon, hell even We Were Soldiers, but 1917 didn't even come close to any of these movies mentioned. This movie tells a simple story, which you pretty much have figured out about 15 minutes going in, not a lot of suspense or drama in the whole movie.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'From the very first frame of \"1917\", it is abundantly clear that the film is going to hang its hat on cinematography and technical prowess. Truth be told, that aspect is indeed so good that I\\'d never consider dropping it below the seven stars I gave it. That being said, I really can\\'t vault it into the stratosphere of my celluloid favorites either, due to it being relatively short in the plot department.For a very basic overview, \"1917\" tells the story of two British WWI soldiers who are tasked with relaying a very important message to an adjacent line: the Germans are not retreating, but instead regrouping for a trap. So, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) set off across the dangerous French countryside to relay the message. Along the way, they encounter numerous obstacles and meet a string of individuals both friend and foe. Adding further emotional stakes to the proceedings is the fact that Blake\\'s brother is one of the soldiers about to be sent over the trench and into the trap.There is absolutely no doubt that the visuals here are splendid. Noted cinematographer Roger Deakins truly does work his magic. Whether running through the trenches, navigating the muddy quagmires of no-man\\'s land, or simply traversing the countryside, this truly is a sight to behold. Of course, the thing everyone is talking about is how the film looks like one long take (not true, of course, but expertly camouflaged). While I found that to be technically more of a \"gimmick\" than anything, it does structurally provide the forward momentum that a film like \"1917\" needs.Which, actually, brings me to why this movie will never be one of my favorites. Perhaps this is as much personal preference as anything, but I just need more plot \"meat\" to sink my teeth into. Because the characters are always rushing forward on some urgent task or plight, there are precious few times to stop and really be at all introspective about what is happening. This isn\\'t so much noticed \"in the moment\" when the action is hot-and-heavy, but upon conclusion my thoughts rolled more towards \"what am I actually taking away from this experience?\", with (unfortunately) the answer being \"not all that much\" in terms of overall plot/themes.So, the way I see \"1917\" is that if it doesn\\'t win all or most of the technical or cinematography awards at the Oscars, it will be a shame. But is it in the territory of Best Picture? I would argue no...there just isn\\'t enough substance to take that leap.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This film is dedicated to the grandfather of the film's director and co-author, Sam Mendes (nominated for Oscars in both the director and original screenplay categories). The grandfather was a messenger for the British army in World War I and told Mendes many stories about the war. The two main characters, Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), are ordinary infantrymen, both lance corporals, who are given a mission by General Erinmore (Colin Firth) to deliver a message to Colonel Mackenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) cancelling an attack that is doomed to failure. (The telephone lines are not operating.) They have to walk/run nine miles through contested terrain, and some of the individual scenes are quite horrific. The film set is over the days of April 6-7, 1917. The Germans have withdrawn to pre-prepared positions later known as the Hindenberg Line, and the British are pursuing them, not knowing that the Germans have prepared traps. One of the personal touches is that Blake's older brother (Richard Madden) is under Mackenzie's command.\\nThe film's gimmick is that it was photographed in such a way that it appears to be just two continuous takes. The break occurs when one of the main characters is hit on the head during daylight, and it is dark when he wakes up. All the other cuts were cleverly disguised. Nonetheless, this puts the film in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock's Rope in which all the takes were exactly 12 minutes, a limitation caused by using traditional film, but the cuts were disguised to give the illusion that the action was continuous. This film was the well-deserved Oscar winner in the cinematography, visual effects, and sound mixing categories.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'If I were actually attempting to fill out my 11-20 of a top 20 of all time, Sam Mendes\\' 1917 would be fighting for a spot. I adore this film. From opening frame to closing fade out, I think this is the work of a masterful voice in complete control of his technical gifts while using extreme intelligence in the use of images and telling an extremely affecting emotional story on top. This is a film I am going to be watching repeatedly over the coming years, and I think I\\'ll be getting more out of it with every viewing.First, the required comment on the \"one take\" stuff. I do think this story could have been told without the gimmick. I think it works marvelously well as it is, and I do not want to change it, but I bemoan the fact that the discussion of the film always seems to revolve around the method. I think it\\'s an easy, low-hanging topic that a lot of people can latch onto and call distracting, seemingly hobbling the movie in their eyes. I wish that conversation didn\\'t have to happen.That being said, the \"one shot\" (it\\'s actually two, but whatever) is executed really well. There are moments where invisible cuts seem kind of obvious (like when Scofield is getting out of the truck, the angle on him from one side of the wipe to the other, hidden by a coat, doesn\\'t feel quite right), but otherwise the technique ends up working best in its biggest and its smallest moments.There are several obvious influences to 1917, but in terms of moments, it\\'s Saving Private Ryan that came to mind first and foremost to me. In my review of Steven Spielberg\\'s masterful World War II film, I said, \"In a movie that has two fantastically large action sequences (D-Day and the Battle at Ramelle), its best moments are very small.\" I feel much the same way about 1917. There are two scenes in particular that call that to mind. The first is in the small French town on first, Scofield ducks out of view of the occupying Germans and ends up in a small hidden room with a French woman and a baby. The kind gentleness between Englishman and French woman, her turn of emotions from terror of the new man in front of her to terror for him as he decides to leave and continue his mission, and Scofield\\'s immediate self-sacrifice at the sight of the young child, offering up every piece of food he has as well as some milk he had picked up along the way, is a marvelous quiet little moment. It works almost as a short film unto itself, but it\\'s actually a key part of Scofield\\'s emotional journey. The second moment is the final scene of the film, where Scofield meets Lieutenant Blake and gives him news of his brother. The quiet way both men barely control their emotions demonstrates the power of reserve in film rather than excess.So, the story itself. Word has come that an advanced until of sixteen hundred men are falling into a trap set by the Germans who are performing a feint back into their own territory and readying a much stronger push. In order to head off this disaster, the general sends Lance Corporals Blake and Scofield out to hand deliver a message to the Colonel in charge that orders him to draw back. Blake and Scofield need to advance through No Man\\'s Land to the abandoned enemy trench, across a river, through the small French town of Écoust-Saint-Mein, and to the hidden English position. Without knowing what they\\'re marching into, every step feels like it could be their last. Quiet, relaxing moments are few and far between the extended moments of tension and terror as they question what is right around the next corner.The story is simple enough, but it\\'s the execution that really sets the movie apart. From the beautiful images of the burning French town with Scofield in silhouette to the use of cherry blossoms, the movie is gorgeous. On top of that, it\\'s not just that the movie looks really good, but it uses its images really intelligently. The easiest way to look at that is to point to the structure of images. We start in a green field and we end in another green field, but in between Blake and Scofield march through mud, blood, swim through raging torrents of water, and run through a ruin of a town on fire, feeling quite a bit like Hell. It feels like a descent over the course of that Good Friday, with the nadir coming in the small dark hours between Friday and Saturday. As Scofield gets to the line, desperate to stop the attack before it begins (with obvious echoes of Peter Weir\\'s own masterful film Gallipoli), he jumps out into a green field just as artillery are beginning to rain down on it, starting the process of tearing it apart into the No Man\\'s Land we had previously seen our characters wade through. It\\'s that desecration that Scofield is out to stop as much as saving the lives of the sixteen hundred men. It\\'s a visual reinforcement of the idea central to the story.Scofield\\'s emotional journey, though, is the real center of the film as a whole. When he starts the film, he\\'s recently traded away his medal that he was awarded for fighting at the Somme for a bottle of wine. The idea of glory has been eroded to nothing with him, and it\\'s through Blake that he begins to open his eyes again. That\\'s why the meeting with the French woman is so good. Scofield has made a promise to see the mission through, not because it\\'s his mission but because he\\'s forced himself to adopt Blake\\'s sense of duty and dedication. Almost by osmosis, Scofield has begun to be less cynical towards the fight around him. He goes from, after barely escaping the booby-trapped German line, nearly walking back through No Man\\'s Land to the relative safety of the English line to offering up everything he has to a stranger. It\\'s the enormity of the experiences that he\\'s going through that are changing him, from a close death to a near death experience and finally to the sight of a lone woman with a baby not her own, desperate to survive for just one more day, that pushes his worldview so that by the time he does get up over the lip of the trench to run through those green fields to deliver his message faster, it\\'s a believable moment of selflessness from him.My brain was firing on every cylinder as this movie progressed. It was about the halfway point when I realized I was watching something truly special, something more than just another great movie but something that stood out from the rest of the crowd. I haven\\'t been moved or engaged with a new release like this since Terrence Malick\\'s The Tree of Life. Sam Mendes made something absolutely incredible with 1917. We don\\'t seem to get traditional war movies anymore. Instead we get directors who made studios a lot of money in a franchise followed by almost esoteric new takes on warfare. Namely, I\\'m thinking of Christopher Nolan\\'s Dunkirk and this. I can\\'t really complain that we\\'re not getting movies about generals pointing out over a field and demanding a flanking maneuver when we\\'re getting stuff like this.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"It's over seventy years since Alfred Hitchcock made Rope, which tried to tell a thrilling tale of murder in a swanky New York apartment location with as few shots as possible, the director hiding any sneaky splices with clever visual trickery. For First World War adventure 1917, Sam Mendes pulls off the same illusion, only with the advantages of 21st century technology, meaning that his film is far more seamless and able to cover much more ground: the vast, body-strewn battlegrounds of northern France, to be precise, where Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are given the unenviable task of delivering a letter to advancing British troops heading into a trap that could cost 1,600 lives.There's no denying that 1917 is an amazing technical feat, with many an impressive shot as Blake and Schofield risk life and limb to head into enemy territory. Director Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins pull off the seemingly impossible on many occasions, the camera gliding and sweeping over muddy war-torn terrain, in and out of trenches, and through numerous ruins, rarely leaving the protagonists, clearly the result of much planning and impeccable timing. As such, 1917 is, for the most part, an incredibly immersive experience, putting the viewer right in the thick of it with the heroes, the action both intense and visceral. Occasionally, however, it's all just a little too clever for its own good, with a few moments that are so technically jaw-dropping that they tend to draw the viewer out of the film wondering how the shots were achieved. It's a double-edged sword, that movie-making wizardry!The simplistic script also works for and against the film. I liken the story-line to that of a 'first-person shooter' computer game, where the player controls a character who must complete a mission, overcoming various hazards and enemies along the way, There's not exactly a lot of depth to it -- it's about getting from A to B without being killed, and that's pretty much it. On the flip side, the minimalistic plot does mean that there's a fair amount of action to be had, so I'm not complaining too much. I do have a couple of minor niggles, though -- and considering the incredible attention to detail given to the visuals, I wish that Mendes and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns had managed to write their way round these issues a little better: firstly, trusting a German pilot who has just been shot out of the sky.... stupid, stupid, stupid. Number two: milk... just sitting there for the taking, with no-one else around (and how convenient for a touching scene later on). And lastly, a whole battalion sat listening to someone sing, with no-one on look-out - it's like they're asking to be shot!Despite its problems, I would still recommend the film, especially to those interested the whole process of film-making -- the sets, the costumes, the carefully choreographed action, and the camerawork are astounding, and worth the price of admission alone. If you become invested in the characters and their mission, then that's just a bonus.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.\"},\n",

However this message urges the colonel to stop the attack since the supposed withdrawal of German forces is feigned and intends no more than attracting the British troops to a trap where 1,600 British would be killed. This message is needed because the phone lines had been cut by the Germans. The two men must cross a no man's land to get to the Colonel's battalion.

Even if afterwards you decide that actually you didn't like it as much as you expected, for the two hours you are watching it, you will be utterly immersed and you can't say that of too many movies.\"},\n",

Third, the camera work and the only few CGI effects are amazing too. But, on the other hand, the script here is not quite original and the storyline is quite weak. To add, some scenes looks like unrealistic or unbelievable.\\nSo, overall a pretty good war film but not a masterpiece like Saving Private Ryan. Enjoy.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I saw 1917 in a theater. I have not seen a movie in a theater in a while and I felt a bit of sticker shock at both the ticket price, and the price of popcorn. Furthermore, about halfway through the film I realized I had to go to the restroom and I found no good way to pause the movie. Anyway, about the movie. \"1917\" reminded me of the movie Dunkirk in that there was plenty of action and very little character development. I would have opted for some more character development in both films.Martin Scorsese has said that a lot of today\\'s movies remind him of video games. Scorsese was referring mainly to superhero movies but to some degree \"1917\" might be included in that, a battlefield video game with potentially dangerous structures everywhere.I\\'ve said the negative things, now a few positives. The acting was good. Everything seemed realistic in that it felt as though I too was walking down through one of those WWI frontline trenches. And there was a lot of time and effort spent on the sets. They were detailed and realistic.I gave \"1917\" 8 Stars. With just a little more character development, and the subsequent additional empathy for the characters, \"1917\" could have been a 10. On the other hand, maybe they made exactly the movie they were going for.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'In addition to two \"James Bond\" films, Sam Mendes has made many moving and strong works, such as \"American Beauty\", \"Road to Perdition\" and \"Jarhead\". This time Mendes returns spectacularly and poignantly to the war theme with \"1917\". The undercover favorite at the next Oscars (he has been nominated for ten trophies). Well, the Oscars have long ceased to be as important as they used to be, but of course I\\'m happy when a film like this is honored. For me, \"1917\" is already one of the best films in 2020!1917: The British soldier Lance Corporal Blake, together with his friend Lance Corporal Schofield, is ordered to cancel an attack on the Germans. To do this, they have to travel a long way to get to the western front. It\\'s about saving hundreds of soldiers from a massacre. The order is all the more important for Blake because his older brother is among the units ...The film got into conversation quickly because \"1917\" is arranged so that everything looks like one shot. Of course there are some hidden cuts here (as with \"Birdman\" from 2015), but visually \"1917\" stands out right from the start. A beautiful and breathtaking looking film and the reason is quickly determined: Roger Deakins. He is the best camera operator for me in his field. One of his most recent projects, \"Blade Runner 2049\", is one of the most powerful and beautiful films of all time for me.In Mendes\\' film again he creates unique images and scenes. Like how a city lights up in dark flames and tranforms into a real hell. Then it gets really intimate again when the camera follows the two soldiers into a mine. One spectacular setting chases the next. For this reason alone, you should see this film. Thomas Newman underlines the visually stunning epic with a moving score. Perhaps a little too sentimental for some, but I found Newman\\'s score to be very moving (which funnily fits the visual style of the movie), no matter whether it were the emotional or the dark, atmospheric moments.Fortunately, the film can also convince in another area: the story. For some it may just be a film in which two soldiers have to achieve a goal, but for me it is exactly this simple story that leaves a lot of space for visual storytelling. There are also longer dialogue scenes, but \"1917\" often also works as a very calm war film, which is more about the physical challenges. But a figure can also grow on it, which in my opinion is shown stunningly.The cast is wonderful: George McKay and Dean-Charles Chapman are both great as protagonists. In addition, big names shine, such as Colin Firth or Benedict Cumberbatch. I appreciate the fact that many of the characters, both meet along the way can only be seen once (which also applies to the locations!). Mendes creates the feeling of having to go a long way with the two main characters, where you don\\'t look back, you just move forward.Conclusion: \"1917\" will surely remind many of Christopher Nolan\\'s \"Dunkirk\". Both films have a similar structure and similar themes, but each film is something different. I was a little afraid that \"1917\" would try to be the new \"Dunkirk\", but Sam Mendes made the film something special (like Nolan did with his movie). A moving war drama that is completely convincing both visually and with its history!'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"There are a great many movies that I hold off on watching until a few years after they are released, and this is one of them. I can't say exactly why I do this, but I think it has something to do with the absolutely obnoxious amount of hype certain films have around them. Some movies (including this one) were hyped up so much that everyone was expecting a masterpiece. Now that the hype has died down and I've decided to go see it, I can say that most of it was deserved, but some praise about this movie is misplaced. The movie is somewhat unique simply because it is set in World War 1, a conflict that is typically overshadowed by another war that came 2 decades later. People tend to dismiss movies about ww1 because the technology wasn't as advanced yet I suppose, but this war was way more brutal for the average soldier compared to ww2. I was wondering how they would portray all the horrors of the war when it came to this film, and the marvelous special effects really hammer home the authenticity. The special effects here are really something to behold, but I need to talk about the actual story first. The story in this focuses on two British soldiers, William and Tom (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman respectively), who are sent into hostile territory in order to try and cancel a foolhardy british attack that will leave over a thousand men dead. Both Tom and Will start off in a trench to receive a message from a General that is supposed to be shown to Colonel Mackenzie, commander of another british regiment. They then talk to a seemingly reckless and irritable Lieutenant who tells them there is a gap in some German barbed wire a few hundred feet from their current position. Upon venturing into the abandoned german trenches, they eventually come to an underground quarters with many beds, and a doorway that leads to a very long tunnel. As they're investigating this place, a lone rat sets off an explosive trap the germans left and the roof starts to collapse. Tom and Will manage to escape before they're nearly buried alive. Tom and Will next happen upon a desolate house which has a farm nearby, and even though nobody is in sight, you get the feeling something bad will happen. Sure enough, a german plane is destroyed in a dogfight with british planes, crashes nearby, and Will makes the mistake of rescuing the enemy pilot before his aircraft becomes a fiery grave. When Will disappears for a measly couple of seconds to give him something to drink, he turns around to see the pilot has fatally stabbed Tom. Will shoots the pilot and tries to get his friend to a field hospital, but he's so badly hurt he can't move. Before Tom dies, he tells his friend to find his brother, lieutenant Joseph Blake. Shortly after, Will, now alone, is on the move again. He hitches a ride on a lorry until it comes to a destroyed bridge. Not having the time to go around, Will crosses the remains of the bridge while under fire from a german sniper. After the sniper and Will shoot each other at the same time, the sniper is killed, but Will is left laying unconscious for several hours. Waking up and making his way to a destroyed French town, he tries to evade german patrols in the early hours of the morning, right when the sun is coming up. Outnumbered and being chased from multiple angles, Will ditches his rifle and decides to jump into a river. Upstream, he finally comes across D Company, who are some of the soldiers due to take part in the attack. Knowing he's running out of time, Will searches all over the trench network trying to find where Colonel Mackenzie could be, until he finds him all the way at the end of the trench in a small post. Will insists that he read the letter given to him by the general from earlier, but Mackenzie is convinced the germans are finally close to being overrun and is not about to stop his attack. Will tells him the germans have been waiting for this exact moment in order to trap the british, and the colonel tells his subordinate to call off the assault. Having saved many soldiers from certain death, Will has one more heroic act to perform. In the outdoor medical ward, where wounded from the battle are having grisly operations and amputations performed on them, Will comes across lieutenant Joseph Blake. He provides him with Tom's dog tag, meaning he didn't survive. Joseph is understandably sad, but appreciates all that Will has done to get this far, and allows him to write to their mother. With both his goals complete, Will heads away from the medical station and rests under a tree. While I feel most modern movies are usually too reliant on special effects, 1917 knows that they alone can't make a worthwhile viewing experience. The effects here aren't used as foundations of the story, instead they compliment it, and that's the way it should be. If you're watching this with headphones like I did, you'll likely be impressed by how good the sound design is. The gunshots and explosions have a lot of bass and tend to rock you around, which makes it feel like an actual battlefield. Even when many scenes in the movie don't take place in a battle, you feel it. I thought that the acting was convincing, with George and Dean-Charles accurately showing how horrible it must have been to be a soldier barely in his 20s fighting in the worst war humanity had ever seen up to that point. The landscapes and lighting in this movie are also really nice, since we often see huge expanses of fields and grasslands that emphasize how big of a conflict ww1 was. I shouldn't need to say this, but 1917 is one first world war movie that has really changed the way people view that war's carnage. They even show swarms of riflemen running to their deaths during the climax. Most movies made in britain don't really get a lot of attention here, so when I found out about 1917's existence, I knew it was going to be pretty important.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Photography is the single best aspect of 1917. Acting - Dean-Charles Chapman and George Mackay are still cutting their teeth as actors - is good enough. Direction is first class, especially during the first two thirds.Unfortunately, from the moment Scho (Mackay) is shot by a wounded German soldier, I found it tough to believe that a fully-fledged British Army lance corposal in WWI would just abandon his weapon and try to elude bullets, not just once but at least twice - just as I found incredible that so many German soldiers were such poor shots as to keep missing him when they had him cornered.1917 is a piece of memorabilia to Director Sam Mendes, as his grandfather Alfred was the source of the story he tells us, but that last third tries to elevate the hero and film to virtually supermannish heights, as Mackay runs through his army's attacking lines to deliver the crucial message. As it turns out, he is late, the first wave has already gone on to the frontline.Cumberbatch has a small but, as ever, intensely repellent part, as Col. Mackenzie, who initially refuses to read his general's orders -- another flaw in the movie's credibility -- and who apparently loves to wage war, regardless of costs in terms of men.I think 1917 is a good movie, and it pays homage to two great WWI movies: ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (US 1930) and LA GRANDE ILLUSION (France 1935), but it fails to reach the heights provided by the simplicity and sincerity of those two films.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'It was the assassination of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand at the hands of Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 that set off World War I. When all was said and done, four years and six and a half months later, on November 11, 1918, as many as fifteen million people, civilians and soldiers alike lay dead on the continent of Europe.It remains one of the most misunderstood conflicts in human history\\'s sadly long (and getting longer by the minute) series of wars. But it\\'s a war that hasn\\'t necessarily gotten as much attention from Hollywood as, say, World War II, Vietnam, or the wars America has fought since September 11, 2001. The best films about what Woodrow Wilson once called \"The War To End All Wars\" have been Lewis Milestone\\'s 1930 classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 1957 magnum opus PATHS OF GLORY. One can now add director Sam Mendes\\' \"1917\" to that rather short list.In this movie, shot in one huge long flowing take lasting 119 minutes or so, young British actors Drew-Charles Chapman and George MacKay portray two British soldiers assigned to what could best be called a suicide mission. They have to deliver a message to a British force deep inside enemy territory to call off an attack against a supposedly retreating German battalion, which their commanders have labeled to be a deadly trap. Indeed, this deadly trap, if the Brits fall into it, will result in the loss of 1600 soldiers, including Chapman\\'s own brother (Richard Madden). And in that time, a bond of brotherhood will develop between these two soldiers as they make their long trek across a wide swath of no-man\\'s land, full of body-filled trenches, tripwires, German snipers, and all other manner of the horrors of war the likes of which humanity had never seen before.Mendes, whose directing credits prior to \"1917\" included the 1999 Oscar-winning AMERICAN BEAUTY, 2002\\'s ROAD TO PERDITION, and the 2012 James Bond offering SKYFALL, both directed and co-scripted \"1917\", inspired by the stories his grandfather told him about this brutal part of human history, a war that proved most devastating to Mendes\\' native England, not only in the numbers of Brits who were killed, but also in the manner in which more than a few of them died; this was the first known instance, and by no means the last, of chemical weapons being used in military conflict. And while Mendes\\' film does not feature any uses of chemical weaponry like mustard gas in its story, the director nevertheless shows a great deal of the brutality and inhumanity of this war, and how Chapman and MacKay keep their humanity about them in a situation in which bloody death is a constant thing. That he was able to do this in one long single take from start to finish is indeed an incredible achievement; it is a technical marvel. But Chapman\\'s and MacKay\\'s performances as the young soldiers offer up the importance of how innocence is always the first thing that gets destroyed in war, helping make \"1917\" a masterpiece that goes beyond just the \"one-take\" technical brilliance.Mendes is particularly good in the opening section of the film, creating the long flowing shots in the trenches, ones that are, whether wittingly or not, a nod to what Kubrick had done with brilliance in PATHS OF GLORY; and the avant-garde score by Thomas Newman (AMERICAN BEAUTY; BRIDGE OF SPIES) captures both the horror and the humanity of the situation at hand. While Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch, both great actors on their own, do have roles in here, the focus remains on Chapman and MacKay throughout, ensuring that \"1917\" does for World War I what both ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and PATHS OF GLORY had done before it: find a spark of decency in one of humanity\\'s darkest times.'},\n",

There is limited emotion shown by the main characters, scenes that suspend reality and cliche, cliche, cliche.Our hero finds a bucket of unspoilt milk at an abandoned farmhouse beside the only cow in sight.A trip wire is tripped by a rat in a bunker in which the two soldiers are in, one is in scratched while the other is buried under rubble, He is dragged out of the rubble with not a scratch, only to have some dust in his eyes. Yet the explosion was so significant it forces the entire large bunker to collapse.Our hero is shot at by a sniper while crossing the bridge. I thought at this point that we finally might be able to see a tense scene. In other good war films this game of cat and mouse might have lasted several minutes. No need. Our hero somehow immediately locates the position of the sniper and is able to shoot and would him. Stunning marksmanship.Yet only two scenes later our hero is running through a town in rubble being shot at by German soldiers no more than 20 yards away and isn't hit.The worst part though, even worse than the tacky scene with the French woman and child, is his escapade down the river, through the rapids, and down a waterfall only the exit the river right at the point at which the battalion he was attempting to locate is luckily only 15 yards away.Things just seem to randomly work out for our hero, and quickly. There needed to be a few sequences where the hero is faced with the enormity of the situation, loneliness, desolation. Rather each time one chapter is finished he is immediately assisted in movies to the next.This film pales in comparison to films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. An opportunity lost. I left the cinema modestly entertained yet empty and disappointed.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The GOAT cinematographer Roger Deakins is now just toying with us mere mortals. His latest film is one big flex, proving how a war movie can be shot to appear as one continuous shot. His photography is stunning and basically makes this movie what it is. Sam Mendes provides reliably great direction and Thomas Newman's terrific score is pulse-pounding and urgent. The unknown lead actors are excellent, as are their more famous counterparts. The main flaw of the film is the lack of substantial character development or plot. 1917 is definitely more of a technical achievement than a full-fledged masterpiece as some are claiming. However, the classic trifecta of Mendes, Deakins, and Newman continue to work their magic.\"},\n",

Teaming up with the master of craft Roger Deakins and successfully casting a stellar lead - George MacKay, Mendes has orchestrated an exhilarating journey through the horrors of war.Amazing filmmaking mastery, every element of it at play in \"1917\", makes it one of the (if not \\'the\\') best war epics of the 21st century, taking its rightful place besides the great \"Saving Private Ryan\" in my book. It\\'s not a movie with an extensive plot, but rather a tightly packed depiction of the fundamentals of war. As we\\'re following - quite literally - our main protagonist William Schofield, he takes us through all the dirt, mud, blood, sweat and bullets, while also never forgetting the meaning of friendship, companionship and all that\\'s beautiful inside a man. George MacKay truly shines in a portrayal that feels intimate to the viewer. While unmistakably being the very central character, the rest of the cast plays their parts excellently as well. One can\\'t begin to compliment enough the aesthetical pleasures of \"1917\", it\\'s masqureeding as a one-shot movie, very impressively so, and shows off an effortful down-to-the-last-detail production design. Really, it must be the best looking, most jaw-dropping war movie since the 1998\\'s \"Saving Private Ryan\". Original score is no less impressive & I\\'m willing to bet the lot of us were happily surprised (and soon emotional) when hearing the \"Poor Wayfaring Stranger\" far away in the woods.Believe all the people who recommend experiencing \"1917\" on the biggest screen You can find - they are absolutely right. Sam Mendes\\'s latest is an impressive feat, a breathtaking cinematic expierence, a war film with as much horror as heart. My rating: 10/10.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is a perfect film. It's not only captivating, moving and thrilling but it's also one of the best crafted movies ever made. My favorite things about it is how easy it is to remember all of its scenes in a chronological order. Every single scene is an element and a tool for the progression of the story. It doesn't matter if it's a crossing of a battlefield, pushing a cart or having a one on one shootouts with the enemy, it's all beautifully done and an example of how continuity should be executed. My favorite scene is the one in which we see the soldiers sitting in a big circle and listening to the Wayfarig Stranger. In this scene, one of the most touching I've ever seen our hero finally reaches the soldiers he's trying to find, but he finds that out only after the end of the song, because it's so electric that nobody really notices his presence there. The death of one of the main characters also serves as an example of a wonderfully crafted picture, because it's as sudden and realistic as none of us expect to see. Another interesting feature is the pain that the characters go through. Its constantly present on screen with characters putting their bleeding hands in a rotting corpse, being blown up, shot, beaten and chocked to death. One of my favorite things about the film is the fact that it never addresses the physical pain and the injuries that William Schofield constantly sustains. Every once in a while he sits down for a moment, touches the back of his head, which is bleeding of course and at the next moment he is back on the road. The fantastic Oscar worthy cinematography, direction and effects add the finishng touches to this timeless masterpiece.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I haven't gone to the cinema much for years now and it's not just the high prices that put me off but also very few films really appeal to me. I would rather watch a documentary or a play or sit through a classical music concert rather than a film for the sake of it.So when I read that the director Sam Mendes was going to make a film inspired by his grandfather who served during the First World War, I was rather curious and after seeing the trailer pop up on my Facebook news feed, I decided to go and see it as it looked promising.The plot of the film revolves around two lance corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) who are sent on a mission to inform fellow soldiers who are about to launch an assault against the Germans that they are walking into a fatal trap. For almost two hours the viewer, through the seemingly one long continuous shot employed by Mendes and his team follows Blake and Schofield as they make their way through enemy lines in order to deliver that crucial message.1917-george-mackay-reviewAlthough one of the premises behind Blake and Schofield's mission was a bit contrived, the film succeeds in portraying the conditions in the trenches - the acres of barbed wire, piles of decaying corpses both the human and animal kind and life in the trenches. There is also the contrast between how the British and the Germans built their trenches and the camera angles do emphasise that.I came across one review that described 1917 as like watching or playing a computer game and some of the scenes do remind me of my childhood playing Super Mario Brothers where the two intrepid characters dodge bullets, enemy soldiers, and mud as well as trip wires. Given the urgency of the mission, the script sticks strictly to the main plot and avoids going into introspections and backstories (which are instead woven into the conversation between the two men). Better yet is the absence of subplots that would have detracted from the narrative.Too often several movies and TV programmes fail because they are poorly written, suffer from the lack of narrative coherence as well as attempt to ram down an agenda down its viewers' throats. I see 1917 as a breath of fresh air - not only is it good old fashioned story telling but is also proof that sometimes, less is indeed more.If you haven't seen the film yet, I highly recommend it. Below is the trailer that gives you an idea of what it is about:\"},\n",

It is art rather than entertainment or history. Having done exhaustive research on the war for One Night in a Bad Inn, many visual details were familiar. I don't remember being so affected by a movie since the Passion of the Christ. I think seeing it on the big screen amplified the intensity. We saw it in XD. I also can't recall a movie in which the music was this effective in amplifying the drama; the music sweeps you into the scene. I found it remarkable that the leads were played by unknown actors while three A list actors played cameo roles. Though the director's grandfather was in the war and one of his stories was the inspiration for movie, the story line was fictional as were the characters. Telling the details of history was not the point of the film. Telling the broad truth of a war that was one the greatest tragedies in history was.\\nI suggest sitting toward the back of the theater.

In Hollywood you feel someones just gone to a giant warehouse with the year you want to portray on it - and rolled out all of the correct bric-a-brac.So I imagined I knew what this film would be like, before I'd seen it.So putting it on, I was absolutely blown away.There's not many movies where I could say that I kept rewinding and rewatching the first 6 or 7 minutes ,three or four times before continuing simply because I couldn't believe the staggering set design, the imerisive camera. This was even before any shooting starts.There was none of this close up camera work, to hide the lack of extras and protect the budget. There was none of that scooby doo running down corridors thing, with the same things going past every few seconds.Instead - what we get is something that feels immense, authentic - and you spend a lot of the movie - just thinking HOW in gods name did they do that.It also didnt suffer from any of that British vanity, that all of its soldiers were cheerful cockneys with their chums, or stiff upper lip stoic officers - so you get a measured feeling that this could be taking place now, and a little part of me thought that perhaps it would have been nice to have had the actors date their accents a bit to be more authentic.\\nAs it was the actors could be anyone you met in the pub - where as the reality is, you've only got to listen to a movie of people talking from the 1940s and you know absolutely that they talk differently.\\nThat for me would have improved the movie, but I guess viewers may have felt less involved.But a staggering technical achievement that I've never seen in any movie before.\\nLoved it\"},\n",

I\\'d been wanting to see it since it was released but was always sidetracked by something going on in my life. I arrived about 2 minutes before it began. Trailers just wrapping up.I had NO idea what to expect or what I was going to see. I\\'ve seen many a war movie, from the black & white era to 1998\\'s Saving Private Ryan and Fury in 2014. .....but (and I am not exaggerating) , this film has captured exactly every feeling, emotion, action of those made to fight in the truly nightmarish and \"holocaust like\" places that are the front lines and battlefields.They have also fully captured the look of everything a military set up and used in World War 1. The look is sad, scary, somber and in some cases as dark as war truly is. The cinematography, yes, does pull that off perfectly .So, two British soldiers are chosen to get a message to another regiment many miles across \\'no man\\'s land\\' (where if the enemy spots you , you are likely to get shot and killed). The reason for this is, the Germans have retreated but it \"may be\" a trick. So they have to get there to warn them and find the brother of one of our guys as well.From the start, the bulk of the first half is filmed in \\'real time\\'. Following every move of these 2. Without giving anything away, there\\'s a slight pause of darkness, then the real time pursuit continues. I was astounded at how steadily and perfectly the camera followed along.Lastly, in an early morning scene in a village, the true look of war/night time battle is (once again) shown by (I can only call it astounding) visuals and cinematography.Usually a few hours after a film, I\\'ve forgotten most of what I\\'ve seen. In this case ....even if I never watched this film again (and I will) there is no way I will ever forget any of this.Much like those who survive wars , they never forget either. World War 1 , for a long time after 1930\\'s \"All Quiet On The Western Front\" , was very forgotten and thought by younger generations as \\'not a serious war\\'. This movie , like Western Front, shows that is not the case. At 3:01PM, movie over.I put no spoilers in here because , I feel , it is not boring and it\\'s certainly something unforgettable.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'One of the frontrunners for this year\\'s Oscar for Best Picture is Sam Mendes\\' epic World War I film, 1917, starring Dean-Charles Chapman, George MacKay, Daniel Mays, Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch among others.Mendes (Director of Skyfall, Road to Perdition and American Beauty) helms this film, which has been nominated for ten Oscars including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup/Hairstyling, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. The film already took home wins at the Golden Globes in Best Picture-Drama, and Best Director.The film is a taut thriller filled with non-stop tense moments as Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield, officers in the British army are tasked with going through no man\\'s land, behind enemy lines, through a web of peril to deliver a message to their fellow soldiers to call off an offensive as where they plan to attack is a trap. The attack is planned for the following morning at dawn and time is short.One of the most unique parts of the film is how it is shot as a \"single shot.\" Meaning the entire film is one continuous scene. It shows the soldiers on the run through the multitude of dangers without stopping. There are a few places where the scenes were \"cut\" when it transitions from outside to underground in the trench, but the feel of the movie is a non-stop, pulse-pounding, action-packed stream that never lets up.Mendes, who also had a hand in the screenplay, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, is based on stories of the Great War from his own grandfather, Lance Corporal Alfred Hubert Mendes.Mendes commented on his inspiration for the film:\\n\"Our film is fiction, but certain scenes and aspects of it are drawn from stories he told me, and ones told him by his fellow soldiers. This simple kernel of an idea-of a single man carrying a message from one place to another-stayed with me and became the starting point for 1917.\"The film, like many modern war films that precede it, focuses on both the hellish nature of war, especially trench warfare, but also the heroism and willingness of soldiers to sacrifice their own lives for the fellow countrymen and the cause. There are also some similarities to Spielberg\\'s Saving Private Ryan set in the First World War.I really enjoyed the film. I think the cinematography and the single shot approach was unique and impacting. The story was compelling. The acting was superb. There were a lot of things the film did well. The score and sound brought an atmospheric feeling enhancing the drama and tension building on the screen.Definitely recommend this film for anyone who enjoys action, thrillers and war films.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"A lot of the time WW1 is overshadowed by WW2 simply because everything was bigger, better, stronger, faster, deadlier etc... But its easy to forget that when WW1 happened, the world did not see a massive war for about 100 years since the Napoleonic Wars and the French Revolution. So with that in mind, it was a bigger shock to the world how destructive this war was with all the new technology.This movie's attention to detail is just pure insanity. Starting from the first moment up until the end, you can analyze every different sequence and talk about how they got everything right and how the war shaped up in the way that it did to create those moments in the film. It's just phenomenal. The trench warfare, the muddiness, the dirt, the unknownness of the enemy's whereabouts and their plans, the brand new weapons, dead bodies everywhere piled up on top of each other, and much more. I think it is must watch for everyone regardless of your interest in war movies.And to top all of this, the technical aspects of the film is also near perfect in my opinion. Incredible cinematography, an excellent use of one-shot filming, amazing sound design, amazing production design, great acting. This movie is the full package.Two soldiers are assigned to deliver a message to stop a regiment walking into their death.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"A war that is now a century old (and therefore no longer widely understood) is vividly captured in this stunning dramatization by Sam Mendes. It portrays the journey of two British infantrymen who are tasked with the near-impossible assignment of alerting another unit of an approaching trap. The one-take film focuses on their grueling slog across no-man's land to the other unit's location. Along the way, their path encounters many instances of danger and surprise.Not always easy on the senses- in fact rarely so- this film gives one a first-person perspective on how hellish and miserable this war was. And although the story is about this particular conflict, one gets the sense that many of the realities of war in this film are still applicable today, a century later. That's what makes this such a startling film experience. As for Roger Deakins' cinematography, it is every bit as breathtaking as one would anticipate from him. Highly recommended to those who are familiar with this part of history and to anyone who has served in combat and who would know the horrors that are portrayed here. And recommended to everyone else.\"},\n",

That was the thing that intrigued me the most.And I actually watched the behind the scenes of how they did it. Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes put in a tremendous amount of work to make every scene calculated. And I mean every scene. It was a step by step process to make sure the one shot take would be executed upon perfectly.And beyond the curtain of the filmmaking, the storyline was great. Having it be a one shot take made it a personal connection between the viewer and the two soldiers. It was a sad, yet uplifting and inspiring movie of showing a partially true story from a story that Sam Mendes grandfather told him about WWI.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Film has won the best cinematography award in Oscars 2020. I would also unanimously agree on that as it is a real treat for the eyes. Camera work , Angles , Colors and Scenes are really top notch. Change of one scene to another was perfectly handled without becoming a harassment to the viewer's eyes. Most of the films does not have this much of beautiful pictures unveiling in front of your screen which is again reminds me of the commendable work by Roger Deakins.Back ground music is another great aspect of this film. It kept edge of the seat every time and added that little sense of suspense to every scene. It is not too much and not barren as well.Story line is a basic one which does not have a huge amount of depth. So it will not have all the elements at the right place to become an epic . There are no twists and turns in the story and one could imagine what would happen right after 10-15 mins from the start. Director should be able to relate the story in a more cinematographic way. But this is a flat story in a movie perspective.Acting is average and I cannot stop comparing Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan with these new actors. Yes it is bit unfair. But I see that is the bar they have to touch. It is set at a great height but these actors should try to get close to that.Film is not a treat to watch as it depicts the sorrow, uncertainty and brutality of war. But it rather signifies the sacrifice made by the front line soldiers who are fighting this war. It also invokes the discussion of power struggle in the world which lead to these wars , humans killing humans. We , Humans , are the ones who make our own graves.\"},\n",

Get the message to the front before something bad happens. It so happens, the brother of one of the travelers is at the front lines about to face certain death.\\nWhile that is an engaging premise, the execution is...well, let\\'s just say there is a reason why there is editing in movies. It\\'s a slog because the travel time is essentially at real time.\\nThough I will give credit where credit is due, how do you make that remotely interesting. Well, predictably, it\\'s to include townspeople. In the French, a couple of faceless enemy soldiers and running into other soldiers. It couldn\\'t just be a walk. Great.

So you see the exercise in it.\\nGranted...director Sam Mendes does something really great, which is not glorify war. You see a LOT of aftermath.\\nHowever, too many dumb things in this movie that anchor it down. The dead run through mortar and gunfire at the end is pure..um...\"Dances With Wolves\" or the fact that the Germans couldn\\'t shoot straight to save their lives. Too many questions bog this down. Was there a better solution here? Probably not. This is THE best a WW1 movie could be.

       "  'Текст отзыва': '1917 is definitely a decent movie, and yes, there is no denying that the ambitious \"one-take\" filming method was very impressive and certainly an achievement, but the writing was paper-thin at times- not as much as Roma was (not that bad), but it had some weaknesses.Before watching it I glanced through a few reviews, and one in particular that stood out as ambivalent is the one I recalled, as I agreed with the reviewer\\'s opinion that 1917 has every war movie cliché you could think of.Literally every cliché is in here as its main scenes, but there is something else I found even more bothersome than that, which is that a few of the scenes are actually dumb. For example, the two messengers witness a dog fight, and they actually identify their allies as winning, but a few moments later the plane they are pursuing is shot down and lands nearby where they are. Rather than play it cautiously, they immediately rush to assist the enemy out of the plane to try to save him. This directly leads to one of them being killed when the pilot stabs the one of them. I mean, what kind of solider in a major war would naively try to save an enemy without their weapons drawn and cautiously? This was very problematic to me.Another issue that I had once again pertained to suspension of disbelief, or implausibility in that the surviving messenger is shot at constantly throughout his journey with bullets just missing his head on numerous occasion. I mean, this guy has plot armour on him that is thicker than season 8 of Game of Thrones, particularly the episode, \"The Long Night\". Everyone around him is constantly getting blasted by bombs and bullets, yet this guy is just luckily and randomly getting missed. For one scene, I would be like, okay, but this goes on in every battle scene all the way through to the end. I\\'m not an expert on WWI, but at what point does the viewer have to say, \"There\\'s no way this is how it was- that a guy can just expose himself constantly to gunfire, bombs, and hellfire, and not get a scratch on him?\"Don\\'t get me wrong. There is no denying that this was a good movie, but I couldn\\'t help but feel those three main criticisms: the clichés, the plot armour/suspension of disbelief, and the thin writing. And pertaining to the thin writing, I understand that they needed to give the actors lines, of course, but every single dialogue felt like they had to put \"that\" kind of scene in to make it feel like a war movie, and that\\'s not to say it was bad, but just cliched.Speaking of the writing, if you are a person who mostly enjoys great, original dialogue and style, then you will probably notice this too. However, you will also be unable to deny how impressive the \"one-take\" filming method is. Another thing to mention is that due to the thin writing, it gave off a very nihilistic vibe a lot of the time. I questioned often if there was any deeper meaning to anything being shown. The reason why is because it seemed like they were going for some depth, but the climaxes were not reaching any moral or lesson. Again, when the pilot was being saved, I thought, \\'okay, he\\'s showing that in war helping your enemy is noble?\"...but then it results in a nonsensical death, and yet still it wasn\\'t trying to say not to trust your enemies in war, either; it was just a random event brought about by being stupid by underestimating the pilot in an unprofessional soldier way for a big war.Finally, I have one other big issue with this. Toward the end, this stranger basically crashes the battalion\\'s gathering, and he begins asking where the Commander is, okay. Not one single soldier asks him for identification to confirm he isn\\'t some rabid dog or assassin. They easily trust him and give up the location of their head Commander. But that isn\\'t all- that is just the very back group he first meets. As he proceeds to chase after the Commander, trained soldiers allow this maniac to just knock them over one by one without being suspicious of him or questioning what his problem is as he advanced through. But it doesn\\'t even end there; when he arrives at the bunker area, or front line, he continues to ask where the commander is, and the other captains continue to immediately comply with his request, giving up the location of their Commander to a stranger like it is no big deal. Seriously? What if he was an assassin? Nobody asks for his identification or why he wants the Commander\\'s location.....Oh, that is until he finally arrives outside his door. It is finally THEN that they make a big deal about what kind of a threat he can be. I had big problems with how this scene was set up. We\\'re supposed to believe the Commander of the entire mission is supposed to be that simple and easy to get to when being pursued by an outside low ranking soldier?On a plus note, I liked the very end and thought most of the movie sufficed as entertaining and a decent watch. However, I would NOT qualify this as a Best Picture favorite at the Academy Awards due to said issues. It had beautiful filming and beautiful shots, but the writing came up cliched and short of what it should require.-1 (Little character development/thin writing)+9 (Cinematography/One-Take choreography success) -1 (Cliches/Suspension of Disbelief/Plot Armor)= 77/10'},\n",

The horrors and beauty of war are all expertly shown, without feeling sentimental or cliche in any way, which was an achievement in its own. The cinematography was, obviously, a true marvel, with a gorgeous soundtrack to accompany this composition of cinema. The story switches seamlessly from loud, intense, and anxiety inducing, to quiet, reflective, and almost tender at times. 1917 is to WWI what Saving Private Ryan was to WWII, and is one of the best movies ever made. I can't lie, with the majority of movies and shows nowadays being absolute trash, like the new marvel movies, or shows like Batwoman, it is movies like this that still give me hope, that there will always still be some directors and writers that actually care about telling a story, without feminism or sjw nonsense to get in the way. This memorizing composition is a true work of art, and I give it a full 10/10 stars.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'About 15 minutes in to this movie, it dawns to you that \"1917\" is something uniquely brilliant and by the end, it\\'s clear that Sam Mendes has arguably made one of the best films of 2019.That\\'s largely because of the very innovative cinematography: The entire film is one long tracking shot. Of course, there are edits, as imperceptible to viewers as they might be. And, to be honest of course, whether or when the film stopped rolling isn\\'t the point -- it\\'s the desired effect that it has endured on our minds.As the camera follows the two British Soldier-runners trying to get across a German-occupied battlefield to deliver their urgent message, it moves around them -- in front, behind, next to, sometimes around a rock or a slightly different route but keeping the soldiers in view. It creates the video game-like feeling that you\\'re the third soldier on the mission.Cinematographers aren\\'t often household names, but Roger Deakins might just become one thanks to this Herculean accomplishment. Given that the film is essentially a one-direction journey in which the camera rarely stops rolling, the production design is a real feat. At times some scenes defies logic but that\\'s how war goes. We follow both the soldiers through a very long trench, a maze of a barracks, and French countryside that\\'s ravaged from the wages of war. That\\'s the hallmark shot of the entire movie.Editing and Sound effects set an almost an eerie effect on the screen. Costumes & make up are top notch. The acting standards are really good, but MacKay will rip your heart out as a low-ranking officer who\\'s resentful of his dangerous assignment but rises to see his mission through, no matter the potential sacrifice.Many people may be reluctant to see a movie about World War I, but 1917 could be a entertainer to even the X Box-PS4 Generation. It\\'s hard to imagine anyone who won\\'t appreciate 1917\\'s originality, heart, and grit. A Must watch movie for people of all ages.'},\n",

A gunshot goes off and you nearly jump out of your seat, half-expecting it to be you that was shot.\\nUnfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to watch it a second time because of that intensity, though.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This film proffers a realistic presentation of a WW1 battlefield and of the threats, the physical terrors, of such a place, but it is actually like a hybrid mediated version of that reality. The result is something like following an avatar in immersive game. This impression is confirmed at the film's end.When it starts the camera has the viewer in the middle of the action and immediately the cleanliness of the soldiers, their spotless uniforms, their fresh faces seem at odds with the mud and shell fire. Then their dialogue is phrased and framed around a type of theatrical form. It needn't be crude or ignorant but it conveys a polished and mannered styling of men talking.Into the action of the film, the two leads take us through the hell of Flanders with mud, rats and corpses, and as these sequences proceed it seems as if the grammar, the structure of the drama is like a multi-level game where the avatars start on one level and then move onto another encountering new places and dangers along the way. As the film progresses it becomes increasingly clear that this is the logic to the film's pacing and drama.The impression is sealed in the second half when our hero is lost in a shattered village and meets a woman - nice quiet moment in the game here - and escaping the ruins falls over a steep waterfall and lands in lush country. Where such a high waterfall is in that part of Belgium is a mystery, and then to enter a sylvan land is even more mysterious. It as if he went up to level 8 in the game.Then there is a battle scene with troops going 'over the top' while enemy shells rain down; meanwhile our hero is running as these shell bursts but do not disturb his relentless legs, nor shake the earth, never mind that the shock waves would upend a normal man.It's not Passchendaele, nor any battle front as documented, but it is like a game where you are a courier sent on a deadly mission to deliver a message before the lives of 1600 men are potentially squandered.It's not as if the film industry hasn't perpetrated a fraud with history, this one just seems more insincere than most.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This is the kind of movie that can pick up momentum by the herd all buying into it without questioning the issues it has. View it with an open mind without thinking about the hype or awards nominations (or wins).This is what I did. And yes, the cinematography is definitely great, and the directing was impressive to choreograph everything in one take, but the thing that matters the most- the writing/story/character development- is not very good.Issues:1. Middle of WWI on the fields and the two main characters are as clean and tidy as a female pop singer about to take stage. There is no facial hair, no dirt, no masculinity to either of them. Very effeminate kind of characters.2. The mission is supposed to be important and imperative, so rather than send reinforcements and snipers to protect the two of them, they send these novices out on their own. It must not have been too important then according to that.3. Why not just save time since it is limited and fly a jet or plane to warn them?4. Since when do trained soldiers save an enemy pilot as if the enemy is a trustworthy ally? Whoops. A first grader would know to use caution when approaching or assisting an enemy. Draw your weapons first, and engage carefully. Don\\'t try to save him like he\\'s your brother.5. Was the prevailing actor the Predator? Why couldn\\'t the enemy snipers hit him in wide open display when he repeatedly kept exposing himself in the open? Why did every bomb near-miss him? I really wanted an explanation for this and it would have helped me to believe it better. Like, is he the bionic man? Is he a superhero who can alter bullet and bomb trajectory with superpowers? If that was explained, it would have made it more believable.6. The Commander of a major WWI battle is so important that an unknown low-ranking soldier from another separate army can penetrate just by barging his way through hundreds of soldiers and the other captains give up his location like he is nothing.7. After a foot chase, just because he jumps in the river, the enemy gunfighter immediately gives up on him- not a shot fired in the water and no pursuit. Furthermore, the letter in his pocket is completely dry when he reaches land. Oh and for \"continuity, one take sakes\" he just happens to drift right up to the battalion he is looking for when he climbs ashore.8. The cinematography is very impressive, but like a few critics said, a) It feels like watching someone advance through stages of a video game and b) the director himself becomes the star of the movie as the viewers are more focused on \"how they can get through the obstacles of the continuity\" than they are \"the story itself\".9. How convenient and how manipulative. The story was lacking any heartstrings so they just had to add a young single mother with a baby who needs milk. As if the camerawork wasn\\'t gimmicky enough, they put that cow in there and the farm to give the soldier milk for this scene\\'s attempt at sentimentalism. Could they manipulate the audience anymore? I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kiss and have melodramatic music playing on top of that.Don\\'t get caught up in the groupthink and echo chamber around this movie. Think for yourself.The emotional depth is lacking and when it is delivered, it feels unearned since there is no character development. Why am I supposed to care at all about these two video game characters who the writer/director has revealed nothing of substance about (at least until the end)?All in all, with that said, it\\'s a good movie, but not a great one and certainly not deserving of any major awards. Frankly, I don\\'t even think this should be nominated for anything except cinematography, and depending on the other contenders, maybe director. It is definitely no better than 7/10 movie.6/10'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Blockbuster Director Sam Mendes (Skyfall) knows how to deliver gut punches through action and he brings an emotional roller coaster with this real time war thriller, where a few men stand tall in the impossible circumstances and find a way to triumph through sheer faith and will.The movie is shot with one take, seemingly in real time, which gives it a bizarre dreamlike quality. This experimental filmmaking goes far beyond what Hitchcock had in mind with his movie ROPE and the final cinematic result of 1917 would have made the king of suspense proud.They say the simpler the story the better it relates to the viewer, and the plot of 1917 is simple enough. All the complexity here is given through the imagery. The movie\\'s name is 1917 and the visuals do give us the taste of what that year was really like. Senseless, impossible and terrifying, where the masses had been driven to insanity, but where a singular spirit still shines. \"There\\'s only one way this war will end,\" says the bitter colonel played by Benedict Cumberbatch. \"With one last man standing.\" Which sums up the movies main theme, as one man\\'s courage stands against incredible odds.1917 leaves a long-lasting impression and takes along time to digest. This is also a film that will appeal to many tastes and ages, as with all its dramatic complexity, at its heart it is no more than an adventure movie.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Everything about this movie hits perfectly. As a long time fan of war movies and just historical films in general I was amped for 1917. As a long time fan of cinematography and how it can shape a films story and tone; I was also amped. If you take the constant one take away from the movie you still have something incredible here. You get a journey out of the 90 min plus run time, and you're in it for every second. The one take makes you feel like you're on this journey with these soldiers. When they get shot at you feel like you got shot at, when they crawl in the mud you feel like you're in the mud etc. The performance by the leading man is great and I hope to see him in future films or tv. A true race against time war thriller is one that I highly recommend not to just cinema buffs but just anybody that enjoys a good movie. While those with short attention spans may think it's boring because theirs not constant blood or witty banter all the time, but don't let that subtract anything from the film. It took a note from Dunkirk in the fact that soldiers when they are in these situations, probably are not talking too much. 1917 flawless, riveting, engaging, 10/10\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I always would think to myself that if I were in the shoes of the men that fought and died for us during the first and second World War's, I would've been one of the brave ones. Someone that would've charged out of a trench or a foxhole without hesitation to take down the enemy. Someone that would instantly lay down his life so others could live on. This film really makes me think twice about what I would've done in those horrid times. As this is the finest example of a military related film I have seen in the last 22 years, you feel like you are there along side those unfortunate souls standing in the trenches. Its terrifying. There were 4 moments in particular where I found myself not being able to take a breath, frozen in fear of what was going to happen next. This is all thanks to the GOAT himself, Roger Deakins. If he doesn't pick up his second academy award this year i'm going to petition it as a crime against humanity. This movie is complex on so many other levels though. The set design is astounding. Another oscar i'm sure this film will pick up. Directing was top notch (I admit i had my doubts about Sam Mendes because of Spectre but he has completely redeemed himself on every level) and I can see Medes picking up his first oscar this year. If you're a person that loves military films like myself, you'll love this movie. If you're a person that hates military films, you'll still love this movie. It definitely leans more to the side of anti-war, as I don't think anyone can say the events that transpired during the 19-teens had any bit of positivity after viewing this film. Death and destruction is what you'll see unfold before you instead of bonds being made between men like most war films showcase. I can't wait to go see this film again. I doubt were going to receive a WWI piece like this again anytime soon.\"},\n",

Devastated would probably describe my state as I returned to the real world.\\nI wasn't sure how the first person (apparent) single shot structure of this movie would work out for me. I did enjoy, if that's the word, Dunkirk and the intimate view of the setting and characters. Immersive is the word of the decade and it can prove tiresome.\\nAs the opening sets us on a journey, I was aware this was going to be a technical marvel. This is the frustration of being a cameraman. I literally hold my breath when an impossible move or a focus pull is executed. I know the pressure of having to get it right first time, but on these budgets it's ramped up to 110%.\\nI'm not averse to these techniques, Cloverfield and even the Blair Witch made it work really well. In this case I thought it was so beautifully executed, that after ten minutes, I had pretty much forgotten it and was totally drawn in.\\nMuch of the credit must obviously go to the DOP, Roger Deakins and a team of grips that pulled this off so flawlessly, however the lead actors literally suffered through every step of the way and I take my hat off to them all.\\nGeorge MacKay has been an actor I have watched grow through a variety of films over the last few years and I think he is destined for a long career. His deeply moving, but perfectly understated performance was the main cause of my emotional connection with the whole movie. He is in every single moment and you feel the brutality and exhaustion for the duration.\\nIncredibly, Mr.Deakins manages to create a series of beautiful frames, even though he is physically miles away from the camera for most of the time and the majority of the film is using available light. One particular series of shots is a masterclass in dynamic lighting and becomes a work of classical imagery evoking Turner.\\nFor all these reasons I would advise this to be seen in an iMax if possible to achieve the maximum effect, it also proves that we really don't need 3D?\\nHow the leaders of the World's nations even consider conflict after the last two catastrophic wars I will never understand. I can only assume they are too consumed with hatred for humanity to spare the time to watch a film like this and learn.\"},\n",

I have never imagined anything like this in my 40 year life while watching a war movie. 1917 shows that the real horror of it was not the body parts, imminent death or the terror . They are very real and horrible of course but no other film managed to shook me with the meaninglessness of the whole concept of war and the madness of nations to put all that effort (digging that trenches !!) to efficiently exterminate each other's most precious assets, meaning their children, to the point that it is their own children and their own future that they waste abundantly at the end. They tell in the movies people go to war to protect loved ones but it is a lie. The loved ones were dying horrible deaths in this movie .\\nI see now that the heroes exist but they should not need to be and the lives that might have saved by their heroic acts were maybe lost the next day anyway.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Saw this on January 9 in the theater. I was eager to see it, having seen many, not all, war movies, including recently the much-better film Midway.A quick review of the plot: During the World War, two British corporals are assigned to travel, by foot, through German territory to bring to a colonel, orders to halt an attack that is to begin tomorrow at dawn on April 7, 1917. Almost the entirety of the film deals with soldiers talking as they pass through all sorts of scenery trying to get to the place to deliver the message. They converse, go through abandoned German trenches, encounter numerous rats and dead bodies and occasionally live people, including a fighter pilot they see shot down in a dogfight. If you\\'re looking for great wartime action scenes, look elsewhere.That\\'s really about it. We get to know a tiny bit about the two lead characters, virtually nothing about anyone else. There are plentiful scenes involving soldiers walking and breathing heavily, many dizzifying scenes where the camera pans around a room or an outside scene. I know someone who is sensitive to even TV shows where the camera pans around and believe she would have had real problems with those oft repeated movements during this film.As one reviewer noted, there are many cliche moments in this film, the kinds of things you seem to get in almost every war movie. There are, as others have pointed out, many things that seem highly implausible or unrealistic.Now I loved the TV series Combat, and they definitely had an episode or two that bore a strong resemblance to what this film presents. Only Combat did it in a 50-minute (minus commercials) presentation. Picture this as a three-part Combat. It just seemed to drag along, the same plot, just extended over two full hours.For soldiers in a hurry to get somewhere to deliver a certain message to save the lives of thousands by calling off an attack, our heroes seemed to pause ever five minutes to do things they need not do. They also seemed to veer off course repeatedly, to go through every building close to their route. I kept wanting to call out, \"Quit stopping for tea (actually a milk break) or to look through every building within sight. Just carry on with your mission!\"Since this is a fictional film, we viewers are not even learning about an actual World War I battle, nor about the lives of real people. It was a visually stimulating film in terms of the bleak shots of battlefields and trenches and such. But I was just left with a sort-of empty feeling as it was concluding, like, \"So that\\'s all there is to this?\"Had it been made in the early 80s, with an \"R\" rating, I imagine I would have heard some mild obscenities (of which we had many here) and a couple of F bombs. Since we are so much more sophisticated today, they must have had at least 65 uses of the \"F\" word, including one non-com who must have used over a dozen in his 2 minutes of screen time. Note to movie producers: You can make a realistic, earthy film without having to weakly resort to cussing nearly as often as this film does. They used to talk about \"gratuitous sex\"...this film truly had gratuitous cussing. It didn\\'t advance the plot or develop the characters, it was just there for no purpose.I think my rating of 4 is accurate.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'A war movie that has a long-lasting mental impact\\nSimilar to a smart buyer who usually checks the product review before placing his order, a cautious viewer like me always checks the IMDb rating before determining the worthiness of a movie before watching. Based on the high rating I have decided to proceed with this show. And initially contrary to many positive reviews I had my own reservation. The visual effect is quite mediocre to me, compared to those war blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Fury (2014). There is hardly any bombing, shooting, fighting and killing throughout, not that I am a lover of such scenes but that I believe there are essential elements for a war masterpiece.Yet after replaying those scenes in my mind post-viewing the story seems to unfold. It is actually a very tense and indeed intense war movie. Albeit lacking (perhaps deliberately lacking to make a difference) those blockbusting visual effects the seemingly plain scenes actually tell you how two lance corporals are rushing to the frontline to deliver a very pressing and vital command from military top. As some other reviewers say, not a single minute is wasted by focusing the camera lens on the protagonists. In my opinion the lack of fighting is sometimes a suggestion of fighting because it keep you holding your breath while trying to figure out what happens in the next minute. It is a quiet horror just as A Quiet Place (2018) and A Quiet Place Part II (2020). No word needs to be spoken and no horror needs to be manifested to keep the audience guessing. This is probably where this movie succeeds.Although quiet in many ways there is no shortage of emotions in this film. Love, kindness, generosity, companionship, horror, desperation, bravery, gallantry, and above all humanity are all in ample supply. Dragging your comrade from rubbles, holding your mate\\'s hand in his dying moment, attempting to save the enemy from a crashing plane, leaving behind a romantic affair to carry on duty, and sending a dead soldier\\'s message to his family are all exemplary of all war movies. I am particularly touched by the reaction of Lieutenant Joseph Blake (starred by Richard Madden) upon hearing his brother\\'s death. Apparently holding back his sorrow he thanked Schofield\\'s delivery of the message and stuck to his post. Isn\\'t this what professional military personnel do?There is also no excessive artistic performance, only for it to be kept at an essential level. The conversations in this movie are kept at a minimum to make way for real actions. From the briefing of the task to the completion of the duty, all you hear is brief, such as \"can you do it?\" or \"your message is received \". Although seeming a bit boring in a movie context it is actually quite telling of a real war scenario where you don\\'t have time to say anything other than conveying the command.Lack of A listers may be a lacklustre for this film. Yet as some other reviewers have mentioned we get a long list of establishment (Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden) and newcomer British actors (Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay). Gee... I cheated! Let\\'s hope these newcomers will make a breakthrough in their career through this great movie.To wrap up 1917 (2019) is an all great war movie, one of a kind indeed! Even a day after viewing, those scenes and dialogues are still playing in my mind. I am truly a cinephile.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Two young British Infantry corporals receive orders from their Company Commander in director Sam Mendes\\' gripping, often surreal World War I movie \"1917\" to deliver an urgent message to rescind a planned frontal attack on enemy positions on the Western Front. These two, clean-cut, lads embark on a genuine journey of hardship that nobody expects them to carry out and brave an obstacle course teeming with ravenous rats, lethal German snipers, while their own men try to sidetrack them. The action takes place in trenches, trucks, rivers, forests, and the remains of bombed out villages. Furthermore, they have only so much time to accomplish their mission, and the odds are stacked against them from the start. Heroism has rarely been portrayed in such realistic terms. Moreover, these two boys aren\\'t trigger-happy, bloodthirsty killers, but naïve souls who don\\'t have a clue what they have volunteered for once they forge ahead. The tragic catch is that only one of them will survive this nightmare. The one who dies doesn\\'t die shooting it out with German soldiers. Instead, he will die trying to help a downed German aviator escape from his crashed biplane before its flaming fuselage incinerates him. \"1917\" captures the horror of the War to End All Wars as it was called by the politicians. Although \"Apocalypse Now\" dealt with the Vietnam War, the two movies reflect the futility of war as well as the humanity of their young men who bore arms in the conflict. What these two fellows experience is unforgettable, but it doesn\\'t depict gung-ho heroics. Instead, men scramble to stay alive and often behave like cowards. Everywhere these two Brits go, they see the many faces of death. Rivers are choked with bloating, ashen-faced corpses, but director Sam Mendes resists the urge to show soldiers getting blown to smithereens or tangled up in their own guts like Steven Spielberg\\'s \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\\nWhen a British sergeant orders Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman of \"The King\") to pick somebody to accompany him to headquarters, he doesn\\'t think twice about taking his friend Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay of \"Defiance\") with him. Schofield isn\\'t especially enthusiastic about the prospect that awaits them, but he tags along with Blake to the C.O.\\'s tent. General Erinmore (Colin Firth of \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\") shows them several maps of the Western Front as well as aerial photographs and explains that the Germans have abandoned their trenches. Initially, the High Command thought this represented a triumph. Instead, Erinmore explains the Germans not only deliberately left the battlefield, but also these sly Huns are orchestrating a Trojan Horse trap. When the British launch their next attack, they will be unwittingly feeding their troops into a German meat grinder. As it turns out, Corporal Blake has been chosen not only for his map reading skills, but also because his brother, Lieutenant Joseph Blake (Richard Madden of \"Rocketman\"), will die in the attack if it isn\\'t halted. Corporal Blake has more incentive that anybody else under Erinmore\\'s command, and the General calculates that this will enable him to complete the mission.\\n\"1917\" is a sprawling, epic saga, and we\\'re drawn into their plight, because we\\'re following them every bloody step of the way. \"Skyfall\" director Sam Mendes and \"Brazil\" lenser Roger Deakins present this incredible mission as it unfolds on April 6, 1917. The film has a documentary feel to it, especially when our protagonists shoulder their way through fellow troops lining the infinite labyrinth of trenches. Each face tells a terrible story, and the officers hold out little hope for survival. Initially, during the first twenty minutes, Blake and Schofield are stunned by the uncanny silence that hangs ominously over the abandoned enemy trenches. Rats the size of racoons scavenge among the kitbags of food left behind by the Germans. Our two lads gaze in stupefaction at dozens of artillery pieces which the Huns have spiked in their urgency to retreat. At one point, the Brits enter a tunnel that appears to serve as a shortcut through this eerie no-man\\'s land. One huge rat dragging a bag of food catches on a tripwire, and an explosion buries Schofield, and Blake digs him frantically out of the rubble. These guys were prepared to fight the Germans, but they had no idea a hungry rodent could pose such danger. Everywhere they go, no matter how desolate it appears, our protagonists discover nothing is what it seems. Death lurks everywhere, especially where they least expect it.\\nAbout forty-five minutes into \"1917,\" after one of the two protagonists has been killed, the other realizes his life literally hangs by a thread. He catches a ride in a truck with other British soldiers, but they are heading in the wrong direction, so he must leave them where a collapsed bridge marks their point of departure. No sooner has he parted company with them than a German sniper starts blasting away at him. Scenes like this spawn white-knuckled tension, and both combatants never really see each other until our hero silences the sniper. When our protagonists embarked on their mission, they were loaded down like pack mules with ordinance and rations. By the time the surviving Brit spots the men he is supposed to save, he has only his uniform to prove he is British. Incredibly, he learns to his chagrin a glory hound of an officer may ignore his message that he has literally died for to deliver. Earlier, when he lost most of what he was lugging along with him, our lone soldier dived into a river to elude enemy fire. Swept downstream, he winds up caught up in a logjam of rotting, bloated corpses that prevent further progress. A night in a bombed-out village has a hallucinatory quality as flares burst repeatedly above the buildings, and their skeletal remains ripple with spooky shadows. By the time our hero attains his objective, you\\'ll feel as traumatized by this spectacle as he is'},\n",

It\\'s a marvel of an achievement in the cinematography department, and the production behind it is anything but lazy. The acting is superb, and believable in every scene.

The movie also knows just when to have a lack of a score to build tension, and when to bring in the epic orchestra to ramp up the drama of the scene. The make up is top notch, and the wardrobe is indistinguishable from authentic uniforms of the time. The story, though simple, is very engaging, and does an outstanding job of plopping you right in the middle of it. For it being the \"one shot\" gimmick throughout the film, I never once felt that the pacing suffered from it, and it only added to the experience, and the immersion.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917\\n2020\\nDirector: Sam Mendes\\nStarring Dean Charles chapman, George makay, Colin Firth, Richard Madden.Bendadict Cumberbatch etc1917 is based within the first world war. Where a battalion of 1,600 soldiers are sent to retreat the Germans but what they don't realise is that it's a trap and a massacre. So, it's down to Corporal Blake (Dean Charles chapman) and corporal Schofield (George makay) to stop this from happening but they will be met with multiple challenges along the way. Wow what a truly incredible movie that hit the mark on every level, visuals, acting and a compelling story lets talk more about this.First, the cinematography was stunning. This film really was firstly phenomenal to look at, and secondly really transported you into the world of the film, and it really made you feel a part of the time, with its scarily realistic set designs and scenery truly making you feel like you were in the battlefield with them. Leading to a truly phenomenal film just to look at and I was often sitting in awe of the film. The visual creativity as well was of the chart, making me truly respect the artistry of Sam Mendes with what he can create.Next the film really made you connect with the two main characters and their performances were fantastic. Due to the film largely being focused on just two characters it gave you more time to truly connect and spend more time with them as there friendship developed throughout the film, so they actually made a good decision by having more secondary characters with only a couple of scenes and two key characters to connect and focus on. And the performance from both Dean Charles Chapman and George Makay were truly fantastic. Considering that I had never heard of either of these two actors before they surprised me at there acting abilities. They showed emotional complexity of what it would be like being a soldier in the war, in truly versatile performances, hitting all the right notes with both serious, impactful and emotional scenes.Next the film did not hold back with showing the harsh reality of war with its gore and action sequences. In order for the film to leave the impact that it did, gory scenes showing the true horrors of war was needed, and it was most certainly shocking to watch. The film did a great job at getting under your skin with surprisingly very realistic looking bodies. A key scene that stands out to me would be when corporal Schofield, is swimming in a lake trying to get on the shore, but there is a large amount of bodies that he had to swim through in order to save himself, this scene truly left one of the biggest impact for me, and I am glad the director did not hold back with showing what war was really like, and especially glad that he didn't play it safe.\\nMy only slight nit-pick that stopped the film from being truly perfect for me was that I felt that they could have been slightly more creative with the films character arcs and development. The film didn't show a lot of back story to the main characters, which I got as it was more about the developing friendship, however it would have been nice to have learned slightly more about them, but this is only a slight nit-pick. As well as the death of corporal Blake I felt could have been saved for the final act, yes this gave corporal Scofield the motivation to find his brother, but perhaps another scenario for the film could have been where Blake reunites with his brother and then gets killed whilst the Germans were attacking, but once again I didn't have an issue with what they did but this could have been how this particular death could have been placed slightly differently.Next, I thought the film managed to achieve an extremely tense tone and well executed jump scares. The film in a lot of places didn't have any soundtrack, which worked perfectly as I felt on the edge of my seat throughout the whole film, and I also think fear of the unknown for the audience and for the characters on the screen also made the film very tense as well. And due to this lack of sound in places there was a surprising amount of well executed jumpscares. These were largely just explosions or gun shots, but they happened completely out of the blue which I was not expecting but it was a welcome surprise for me.My next two positives would be the films surprising amount of emotional weight and its incredible final act. Wow this film was surprisingly emotional, just seeing the large body count throughout, truly made me realise whilst watching how pointless war is, and I think that's a good message to spread. And to have corporal Blake get killed was extremely heart-breaking, due to him not being able to see his brother and the connection he had formed with Scofield you could really tell how sad he was feeling which is another credit to there acting abilities. And the long drawn out scene of his death really allowed the audience time for what just happened to sink in, therefore making it even more emotional to watch. The final act was truly one of the best things I have ever seen. Sam Mendes did an excellent job at misleading you into what was going to happen, he could of easily went the predictable root and just let the message be delivered, but no the soldiers were already on the battlefield when Scofield was attempting to deliver the message. They went all out with fantastic cinematography, surprising cameos and an impactful ending with Blakes brother which really worked as a show of respect for the character and to make you leave the film satisfied.However, my final biggest positive would be how the film managed to look like one continuous take. Wow what a clever creative decision here. Yes, there was clearly a few cuts, but they were very well disguised and didn't affect the flow of the movie. Having one continuous take really gets you immersed in the film, and makes you feel like you are there with the characters truly leading to excellent experience whilst watching, as you connected with the characters more and it makes you feel like part of the movie.Overall 1917 is a true cinematic masterpiece and deserving of all its awards buzz. With a fantastically acted and fantastically crafted immersive film that might be my favourite of the year.\"},\n",

So yes, the highlight of the movie is not it's story but the way in which a simple plot was presented to the viewers.Using the concept of 'One shot' editing, the film is captured in one continuous motion, where the viewers are experiencing the movie in real-time. It is flawlessly executed. The kind of tension built at particular scenes in nerve wrecking. Cinematography gets a big thumbs up. Music composed fits really well into the scene (especially a folk song sung in the movie).Acting by the two main leads is great. Unexpected and surprising cameos.Top contender of oscars.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I knew this movie would be good and I had always been wanting to see it. From the beginning I loved the directing and camera work from the film, obviously Sam Mendez did a great job and I could tell from the first 5 minutes of the movie. The movie was shot without a transition or a cut scene between lines and characters, and it was shot without the use of a walking cameraman. The ability of being able to direct in this way and to focus zooming in or out on a character and viewing the troubles of WWI without a cut scene watching the two main characters walk through the trenches or travel through no mans land gives the audience a view of what WWI was like and they did a great job of representing it. Not that I know about WWI, but because they directed the movie in that way, it gives a great representation of the battles and struggles of war and the hardships that our main characters went through. Directing, Writing, Camerawork were all incredible in this film, that's what made it so special, but I still feel that there is something missing from it, something that I wish they included a bit more character growth and connection with the audience. However, it is still a great film and revolutionizing for film making.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"A side note: I turned up at the local cineplex and the ticket person checked my ticket and pointed out the correct cinema showing 1917. I didn't think I had arrived late but it seemed to have already started. The scene was the trip by the vehicles through the mud and fallen trees. I picked up the story no problem. My impressions at this point of the movie was the extremely inappropriate music that sounded more in keeping with a Star Wars film than something set in World War I. I had similar issues with the movie 'Dunkirk'. Anyhow after 40 minutes the movie finished and I knew something was wrong. I checked back with (another) ticket collector and found that my session wouldn't be starting for 20 minutes. So I managed to see 1917 twice. At least some of it twice.\\nSeeing the beginning made me rethink a few of the issues I had initially felt. Yes the music was still inappropriate and as the volume and tension slowly increased we all knew that something was going to happen. Worse was that the music was continuous through, I guess, 90% of the movie. Why don't directors just leave everything to the sound effects department?\\nI also found that the slight overuse of profanity and gestures a bit out of period. Am open to correction here.\\nTo the movie. When I first viewed it I was not conscious of the 'one shot' camera work until the final conflict. Seeing it from the beginning impressed me so much. The camera work and art direction deserve awards and what is sometimes overlooked is the extras casting. Absolutely brilliant.\\nThe two leads had to hold the whole film together and they did that and more.\\nOk, I have issues, but over all, if someone asked me what I thought, I would have to tell them that this was probably one of the most visually exciting movies of the past ten years.\"},\n",

After 2005's Jarhead, which I myself loved, 1917 is a hugely ambitious step up for Mendes. He has to be commended for using this 'one shot' technique for what seems to be it's perfect use.\\n.\\nBelieve the hype. 1917 is this years Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge, Dunkirk. It's 100% fitting that it's in the conversation surrounding these war greats.The use of the one shot technique for this type of film is genius, as it completely immerses you in the action with little reprieve. Seemingly menial moments like following these two young men walking through the trenches is enthralling & captivating. This is also superbly elevated by the pitch perfect score that is coursing through the veins of the film. Honestly, the score is impeccable, goosebumps a plenty... and the Oscar for best score goes to Thomas Newman, 1917. Then there's Roger Deakins cinematography. Need I say more. It's stunning from start to finish, with some scenes very reminiscent of 2049.\\n.\\nLet's get some minor flaws out of the way. Dean-Charles Chapman (Tommen from GOT) was the wrong casting for this one. A) he's a little too chubby for this role. It's even eluded to at the start there is no food around, yet Blake looks very well fed. Chapman also doesn't nail some of the important scenes, which takes some of the emotional punch away from them. The only other thing to mention might be the fact the Germans can't seem to aim to save their lives. It did start to feel a little hard to believe at times.\\n.\\nGeorge MacKay does a wonderful job as the lead. He hits all the right notes of emotion and intensity. There's also a bunch of great cameo appearances spread throughout the film, including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Andrew Scott in a great little scene where a few smiles are to be had.\\n.\\n1917 is a movie that demands to be seen on the big screen, the biggest screen. It's definitely one of the best films of the year, and an amazing effort in cinema.\"},\n",

I found his character, while noble and brave, to be extremely naive.

This movie has you tense from start to finish. You're constantly worrying what horrible thing is going to happen next to all of these young largely innocent boys and men. No one on either side of no man's land was responsible for the war and yet they were the ones paying the worst price. I always wonder how many incredible athletes, teachers, musicians, doctors and etc. Are lost in conflicts like this.The movie doesn't shy away from violence, but unlike some war movies that are more about the action and explosion of war this one like the king, wanted you to deal with the misery. In the king you see how small wars in that era were. In 1917 you see how large and random they are, but the portrayal of battle was significantly more quiet than I expected. Who knows what is truly accurate, but im the same age as many of those people that fought in that war and it gripped my heart like no other movie has. Incredible.\"},\n",

That scene should have been 30 seconds at best. That scene lasted longer than the ending climatic combat scene. What were you thinking?War movies should be gritty, horrible, and leave a lasting impression, not \"wow the visuals and lighting were amazing.\"A few movies that represent war for what it is without being romantic.Furry.Saving private Ryan (not so much the story but the intense combat)Apocalypse Now.

It's basically a race against the clock, move across enemy territory, against terrible odds, and save massive loss of life. You aren't going to get a lot of extra details about the characters or what's led to the situation they are now in, its purely about the journey and what they have to overcome.For those who thought it was boring or slow not sure what movie was being watched. For most of the movie you're on pins and needles anticipating who or what is going to pop out from behind who knows what. This was a great movie, highly recommend.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"It felt like this film was trying too hard to be stylistic and artsy rather than involve the viewer emotionally. I really didn't care about the protagonist/s much because there was very little character development and a lot of potential opportunities were lost when they killed off Lance Corporal Blake. The movie was just basically about one man's survival from one scene to the next and the filmmakers weren't adept enough to create sympathy for the lone surviving protagonist in my opinion. It's difficult to develop a character that way but it can be done as with films like the Revenant, Castaway and Naked Prey. 1917 felt more like an excuse to show off cinematography and create set pieces rather than tell an interesting story. I'm giving this film a C+/B- because there were some good scenes and a lot of impressive work went into the historic recreation of battlefields\"},\n",

As expected, It is certainly not a comedy, but lighthearted humor doesn't even come into the fray.I thought the seamless continuous shot might be a gimmick that would bridal the film (I don't really see the need to avoid edits), but for this film, it is very effective. It pulls you in with our main character and as the film progresses, so does the immersion and the tension. You really do feel like you are experiencing everything as a witness.On top of that, the cinematography is very ambitious....sometimes beautiful.There are metaphors of the contrasts between innocence and aggression. They are well done and poignant. The score is grandiose if not a bit over the top, but it will undoubtedly allow your tears to well.The acting is beyond reproach and the aftertaste is respect. We've all seen a lot of war movies. This one is less about bravado and more about humanity. Our hero is not the typical bad-ass, but rather a young man who is pretty much obliged against his instinct to complete a mission not only because he's following orders, but mostly for honor and his own soul. In that way, he becomes a hero.Well done with some memorable scenes I will likely never forget.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I was in two minds about this film. I am a big war film enthusiast, but unsure as to what Mendes' take on it would be. There was however no chance I was going to miss this highly touted film. And I'm so glad I went to see this on the big screen yesterday.First of all it is a simple plot, two lads are to go on a journey into 'no mans land' to send a message to another unit to cease them making the big push into what was expected to be a German ambush. Sounds pretty basic, and in essence it is. However, there is enough meat on the proverbial bone to keep you interested, and allows the familiar team of Mendes and Deakins to work their magic.The acting itself was to a good standard. McKay especially was entirely believable and made you go through a rollercoaster of emotions with him. From the scene with his recently deceased accomplice, the scene in the basement with the women and child, and the scenes at the end listening to the man singing and the scene informing the lieutenant of the passing of his brother, were all a contrast in human emotions, and he took to all of the roles well. After watching the film, I am a little disappointed he didn't get mentioned in the nominations for the Oscars (there are others on the best leading actor list that I felt were inferior to McKay's performance). However on this showing, he looks like he has a bright future ahead of him.\\nThere were some big British names making cameo roles. Mark Strong especially was excellent (as usual).\\nAll in all, the cast adequately supported the real star of the film. The cinematography.For me, the real magic of a film is in the detail. Not a performance from a big time actor (although excellent performances help), or masses of special effects, or a plot with multiple layers. All of these things help towards putting together a good film, but for me how the film looks and sounds is how a get sucked in to a production.\\nDeakins and Mendes, are a duo who constantly do this. Deakins especially seems to get the most out of the landscape for whichever movie of his you are lucky to watch. The baron landscapes and locations of 'The assassination of Jesse James', the dreamy electrical world of the new 'Blade Runner' and especially for me the typical North Dakotan vistas of 'Fargo', are only a few of his works that highlight how incredibly imaginative and clever Deakins is. Even the pairs attempt at Bond produced possibly the best looking Bond film of the series in Skyfall.\\nPairing Deakins artistry with Mendes' direction is always a visual treat. Combining the beauty Deakins provides, with the dark and often brilliantly harrowing style Mendes brings to his films, has previously left me wide eyed and ready for more. This is no exception. The idea of the whole film being presented to the viewer as one whole shot, just works. As we are sucked in, cheering for the main character through his long and arduous journey. It seems relevant to shoot the film this way. And at the end you are left wanting more.\\nThe perfect scene to sum up the Mendes/Deakins combo, is when McKay opens the door to confront a German sniper up close and personal. And in typical Sam Mendes fashion, it's a personal and shocking encounter. When McKay regains consciousness, he opens the door to inspect the dead German and out the window he sees the ruins of the town illuminated by flares being shot overhead. The shadows moving as the flare crosses over it, paired with the soundtrack was possibly one of the most stunning pieces of cinema I've ever seen, producing a lump in the throat moment. Visually beautiful.Because of the digital age we live in, I only now buy DVD's of the films that really make an impression on me. This will be added to the collection.\\nWe have seen the majority of the main Oscar nominated films this year, and 1917 should clear up for me (possibly the odd one for The Irishman).\\nThe film takes you on a journey through despair, sadness, joy, humour, anxiousness, and many other for the full two hours. And you believe every beautiful minute of it. That for me is the mark of a good film.\"},\n",

I was hooked from the start and felt like I was in the movie experiencing the journey myself. I have never been so attached from reality while watching a movie. Or should i even use that phrase because what this movie showed was actual reality once. Let's say this movie attached me from the reality of our modern time of peace and just for few hours brought my mind to the reality of war over 100 years ago. This is a movie for all humans with human emotions.\\nI got watery eyed multiple times during the movie. I have got watery eyed during some emotional movies before and I thought that was the level of emotion this movie could bring me and keep at. Not the case. I was shown a whole new level of emotional movie experiences. This movie experience was going to be like nothing else before. It felt like I was building tension inside my body from holding back emotions during the movie. After the movie finished I was in shock. I could only stare at the credits without moving a limb except clenching my fists to hold back tears because I didn't want to start crying in the movie theater. I could feel my heart rate go up and breathing getting shallower and faster. I was even shaking a bit. This was a real moment for me. There was only one couple of people left in their seats clearly emotional too when we finally slowly left the theater after I got back my ability to move. I couldn't say much to my fiancé while we were walking home. She was concerned because I was so quiet and asked me how I was feeling and I only could tell her that I just wanted to go home so I could cry. We got home, I let all the built up emotions out and cried my eyes out to my fiancés scarf while hugging her making her cry too. It felt like my soul was washed when I let the emotions loose with the tears flowing out. It was a relief. I felt pure. This was very unique and personal experience. It's amazing how art can have such an effect on human emotions. I had never been made feel likes this before by a piece of art. Now I have. I am grateful.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'My review of \"1917\".\\nThere are very few movies which successfully pull off illusion of being shot in one continues take.\\nAlfred Hitchcock\\'s \\'ROPE\\' (1948) comes to mind, as well as the opening shot of Orson Wellse\\'s \\'Touch of Evil\\' (1958). More recently \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)\" (2014) directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu earned the best Picture and best Director among other categories back in 2015, which shows how much the Academy appreciates this stylistic yet technically difficult choice of story exposition.\\nBy now everyone knows that Sam Mendes\\'s \"1917\" has yearned the Golden Globe for best film and before seeing it I was bit unsure of this choice leaning towards \\'JOKER\\' as the best movie of the year. Potentially Mende\\'s movie has all the ingredients to be special. First, an acclaimed director in Sam Mendes, second arguably the best director of photography who paints with light in Roger Deakins, the budget of close to 100mil, so what could go wrong? Well perhaps setting a challenge of trying to convey movies full story in real time using what appears to be one continues take.\\nMagician does not explains how he achieved particular trick same as filmmaker usually doesn\\'t show how he created film sequence. By doing so, he is demystifying the process which should only be known to the initiated. However there are widely available online behind the scenes footage, where both director as well as DP explain the challenges of creating whole movie using continues tracking shoot, which follows two protagonists who are Lance Corporal Blake played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay playing Lance Corpal Schofied. Both young army man during the First World War are given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory that will stop 1,600 men, and one of the soldiers\\' brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap. As the story unfolds we are following them through the trenches and obstacles trying to fiulfil their mission.\\nAt first when I though that this movie will be shown in real time using continues take with edits hidden in wipes (movement of the camera which lingers on wall or other objects permitting seamlessly to connect two scenes together in editing making it look as one continues take) I was unsure. When I first heard that \"1917\" employed this technique I feared that it might be used as gimmick, however when I find out that Roger Deakens is involved in the project I knew Sam Medes\\'s picture was in good hands. Most people will not understand how much work it takes to create movie this way. The control of focus and the light alone is a very difficult task. However if one take tracking shot technique isn\\'t used for the narrative purpose, then whole film potentially could fail. That\\'s where Sam Mendes directing comes in to play, who also co-wrote the screenplay which he based on a very personal story of his grandfather\\'s experiences in WWI titled\"The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1897-1991\".\\nSam Mendes is a special director, we could point to many movies which prove this argument. From \"American Beauty\" to my favourite Bond to date in \"Skyfall\". He is a director who is able to convey emotion, without being overly dramatic. There is a subtleness within which he is able to covey inner emotions of the character by using not only actors performance, but utilising blocking (movement of actors in relation to camera) in a landscape scope of the composition. Film of this sort only works if the audience truly feels like they are on a journey together with our protagonists and big credit for doing so needs to be given to musical score which is used to convey danger, emotionality and melancholy when needed.\\nThe reason why this film works is because all of the above mentioned techniques are utilised to tell the story and forward the narration to an emotional impact on the viewer. Yes, the performances are strong, with cameos from Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and charismatic as always Mark Strong, not to mention both leads, but it\\'s the way the story is told, that truly permits the audience to immerse themselves in this WWI epic. After watching \"1917\" I can honestly say, I strongly believe this picture will receive an OSCAR\\'s for the best film and cinematography (in any other year I would pick the \"JOKER\" for the best film and cinematography, but this year Roger Deakens should not be denied) and possibly Sam Mendes for having an overview over all these elements, to create arguably best movie of the year, which up to that point this distinction belong in my humble opinion to the \"JOKER\". I strongly feel Sam Mendes has made his grandfather very proud, in his attempt to bring all the creative pieces together, creating in it\\'s entirety a masterpiece of a movie, which film students will study for years to come.'},\n",

This method adds layers of engagement to the audience as we see developments minute by minute very close to the characters. The subtle scores were mismerising.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Wow! I just walked out of the theater with my girlfriend and we both are still in tears. 1917 is is a beautifully crafted yet epic violent tale of an impossible mission. The style and craft from Mendes directing this film to look like one take is done so well I have never seen anything like it before. Now granted I have seen some good films that are made to look like one take, but this film is done perfectly. The whole film I was shaking with goosebumps one minute then completely sobbing the next and then chuckling at some of the one-liners in the next scene. That being said, this film is building and you can feel it and that climax is so emotionally breathtaking and intense.The performances are outstanding and the cinematography is just incredible. What really ties this film together is Thomas Newman's score that is beautiful yet intense mirroring exactly what the film is. 1917 better win Best Picture and Best Director at least at the oscars and that is saying something in a year like this where there has been so many groundbreaking films and performances. 1917 is my new favourite film.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This 2019 motion picture tells the harrowing story of two British World War 1 Tommies soldiers William Schofield (George MacKay) & Thomas Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) who are ordered to deliver a message about a German ambush before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie too much, composer Thomas Newman's music is jaw dropping haunting yet beautiful to listen to. 'The Night Window', 'Gehenna' and 'Sixteen Hundred Men' are some of the best tracks I ever heard in a war movie. Along with that, the visuals by cinematographer Roger Deakins with his crew are epic. They really did capture the perspective of what a soldier from the first world war will go through with the visuals. Everything about the camera work was near perfect. To add onto that the film was so meticulous edited that it really did look like the entire film was shot with one continuous real time seamless take. It's hard to spot where the cuts are. While some people might think that this way of shooting is highly distracting and gimmicky. The long take sequence wasn't too much of a turn off for me. I think that way of filming works within the story as it shows how vast the scale the dangerous journey is and how much time it takes to get place to place in order to save lives. However, the contrived coincidence moments involving the milk and the truck transfer just appearance out of nowhere was kinda jarring. Plus, I would had like to see the film done without the whole black out intermission flash forward sequence. That took me out of the story a bit as I was reminded that I was watching a film rather than real time occurrence but that's nitpicking. If anything, most of sophisticated camera movement was surprisingly smooth for a war movie. Glad to see that they went the spiritualism third person viewpoint rather than the first-person shaking cam look with their plan sequence. You really get to see all the details such as the vast number of extras with historical well-made accurate costume & make up work trapped in a claustrophobia sandbag trench surround by muddled empty field of craters full of corpses, barb wire, and shell cases. Then there is the wore down farm house including the burn out ruins of the urban settling that reminds the audience that the battles of WW1 weren't always fought in nowhere trenches, but also around people's homes. Surprisingly for a war movie, there was a very limited amount of action scenes here. Instead most of the film has the characters move from one upsetting site to other to build fear and suspense. For the most part, it kinda works. I would rather have that rather than a poorly done large CGI battle. The fake looking special feature failure of Schofield jumping off a cliff into a river to escape the Germans was enough to prove that direction would not work. Instead just seeing them scout around was very intense as invisible enemies are always hinted to be nearby. The acting from these two along with the supporting cameos of several seasonal performers like Colin Firth, Mark Strong & Benedict Cumberbatch was top notch. You really do see the anxiety and heart break spill out within their faces. The movie could has work with just the two main characters being silent and letting the body language speak for itself. However, I do get that it might cause the characters to seem more fictional shallow one-dimensional everymen that the audience can put themselves into rather than realistic living breathing human beings. Nevertheless, I felt that most of the dialogue between them could had been more detail. I really didn't get a grasp of who these characters really were. Regardless I did like the small semi conflict between the two over patriotism and just wanting to survive the war. After all, WW1 by contrast was a global conflagration in which nationalism was the spark. While other war movies might pick a patriotic or antiwar side. This movie was just more focus about the goal of enough saving individuals as possible rather than making a political statement for or against war. There is no better example of that than the beautiful reading of Edward Lear 'the Jumblies' poet sequence & the haunting singing of 'I am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger' later on the film. The character at first feels like he is just a wander in a deadly nonsensical world. Until he finds purpose by seeing unsung heroic done by his comrade for the immediate love of the family unit. That's deep character development. We also see this with the symbolism of the white cherry trees throughout the film. They are use to represent both death and life. For example, the cutting of the trees are the first signs of the salt the earth strategy employed in the war, yet the film points out that in the long run it will result in even more cherry trees growing in the area. The movie even opens and closes in a tree of life settling. It's very powerful metaphor. Fortunately, contrary to many other works about World War I, the film makes no attempt to show sympathy with enemy soldiers. Germans troops in the film are portrayal as uncivilized brute killers when in truth, most of them hold the same moral valor and honor as the allies. While the movie does take others artistic liberties such as the mixer of British units when most of them were regionally recruited and weapons like Mark II tank yet to made. For the most part, the film is historical accurate despite most of it was loosely based on various real-life accounts that director and cowriter Sam Mendes's grandfather told him in his youth. Although the screenplay by Krysty Wilson Cairns might be fictional set in a real historical backdrop; '1917' is one film worth fighting in the trenches for. Highly recommended.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I know that everybody who has seen and reviewed this movie has mentioned this one aspect of the movie but it's the best thing in this movie and that's the way it was filmed and edited to look like a long one-shot. While I was watching this movie, I was playing a fun game in my head of find where they matched the scene up and some parts it was obvious where they ended one scene and matched it to start the next but there were a lot of ones I couldn't figure out where they stopped filming and matched it up for a new scene. This just goes to show how great the editors on this movie were and when it comes time for the Oscars, they get a nomination for best editing. Despite this movie being a war movie there isn't a whole lot of action happening, sure there are a couple of scenes of action but it's not reliant on action, this movie is not boring in the slightest. There is so much to look at and admire about this movie like the cinematography and set design. Just like with editing I hope this movie gets a nomination for best cinematography because there were some outstanding shots that encompass the lighting. I wish I could go further into this but sadly I can't and you just need to see the movie for yourself to understand why. The set design helped bring the audience members into the movie with how accurate the sets looked. When they were in a trench you felt like you were in there with them and when they were out in the open you felt scared for them. In other words, you felt like a fly in the air following them on this journey. In the end, 1917 is just a spectacular war movie and is perfect for people who both love and or hate war movies, this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of them. I have a good feeling this movie will become a classic war film.\"},\n",

Mendes is a wonderful director and I'll pay to see his work any day of the week. All that being said, he cheated. The one shot gimmick was used well. They managed to hide the cuts in post and in camera. I was impressed. Then Mendes cheated. He had the character lose consciousness, fade to black, fade into several hours later. This could have easily been avoided if the characters just left hours later in the day.As for the story, well, it's pretty straight forward - Guy must deliver a message before it's too late. Not much room for anything else. Yet, we still ended up with the usual war movie tropes. I found myself rolling my eyes at times. Additionally, there was a poor use of time and space in the film.It wasn't enough to make me dislike the film, but this is not a Best Picture or Best Director. Maybe Best Production Design. Maybe Best Editing. However, there are far more superior films nominated. 1917 is worth a look in the theater, but don't go in with big expectations.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Sam Mendes First World War epic is a visual masterpiece which warrants every inch of its award hype. This is not a film driven by introspective character narrative and for some this apparent lack of plot, will seem like a deterrent and boring for some. The film focuses on a day in Spring 1917 in France, following Lance Corporal Schofield (George Mackay) and Lance Corporal Blake (Dean Charles Chapman), being tasked by their General to deliver a message to a nearby battalion, to halt their forthcoming attack as it a trap. And from this point onwards the film follows relentlessly the point of view of the two men as they travel through their trenches, across no mans land and through the apparent abandoned enemy front lines.Mendes decision to film using long tracking shots, alludes to the idea that it was filmed in one continuous take, never leaving the leads sides. This, above anything else, has garnered much attention and has drawn criticism for favouring technological technique over narrative. But I would argue, far from detracting from the story, this type of film-making is a character device all by itself and adds to the individualistic war many soldiers endured. This is not your typical Americanised, action film since very little stylised action takes place, there is very little interaction at all within the entire film. Communication between characters is minimal, there are many fleeting interactions, even between named stars such as Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch but this only adds to the realism the film is trying to portray.Following one man\\'s journey, this is not about the holistic nature of war, it\\'s an individual\\'s experience. With that being sad, Mende\\'s is aware he is making a film and utilises his hero with particularly unrealistic chases from enemy gunfire at mere yards away. There are moments that frustrate and where one would say the Schofield could not possibly survive but he is encapsulating the strength of human spirit, the heroic nature of soldiers, the sheer luck some soldiers experienced surviving a war they were not always prepared for. For many, the Great War was not as it was promised: for many they thankfully never even experienced the \"big push\" and fought of boredom and squalor more than anything else.Those looking for action are in the wrong film, they are in the wrong conflict and they are misinformed at what the years of trench-ware actually meant for soldiers. This was not something many men were proud of, hence a particularly poignant moment where Schofield scoffs at his war medals, for what use is a piece of ribbon to a family who will never have their son/brother/husband or father back? Many soldiers died pointlessly and were mere canon fodder for generals who had no idea what they were fighting nor what their plans were from one week to the next. The deaths in the film are not heroic in grandeur but they are in terms of human spirit and they stay true to how many young men died on the fields.1917 is about the individual, lived experience of war, a poetic and visceral display of the battlefields. Brave in its portrayal, realistic in its cinematography and above all else, a more than fitting homage to the endurance of human spirit.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is mostly a well made film, the set pieces are gorgeous, the acting is fine, the cinematography is stunning, fitting soundtrack etc etc it does most things really well and it most certainly held my attention throughout it's runtime.The main issue I had with the film was not the lack of combat scenes (as it focuses mainly on the main characters and not large battle scenes as a whole) it was the lack of realism, for example two young soldiers are given a task by a general to make an important trip to another front in order to halt the allied attack there due to a German trap that is set for them as otherwise many lives will be lost, now why would a general rely on two lower ranked soldiers alone to pass on such an important message, not even sending other runners just two guys across many kilometres and just hoping they will make it, very silly.Other examples include the Germans missing almost every shot when the main character is fired upon and is essentially a sitting duck, shot after shot after shot all close range missing completely, then there are others things missing like background ambience of a war in some cases totally absent, just little things like that.All that said I still think it's a good movie worth watching, it has some great scenes and can be quite moving at times, well worth a watch just wish the producers paid a little more attention to details.\"},\n",

The two lance corporals went through rotting dead bodies and rats feeding on them and ended up by a dilapidated abandoned house. The brits downed a german plane and the plane crushed right next to the house and they escaped by the skin of their teeth. Blake wanted to help the injured german pilot and got stabbed by him. It was a lethal wound and he passed away there and a British convoy found the other. He joined them and travelled at the back of a truck until they reached a collapsed bridge. From there on he had to walk as he was racing against time. A soldier was trying to shoot him from a window of the house by the river as he was crossing the river on the railing of the collapsed bridge. He managed to kill him but passed out too as he was injured too. He woke up and continued on walking through the ruins of some buildings. It was rather heart-breaking when he found a young woman and a baby girl hiding in a basement. He gave them all his food and had to kill a german because and had to jump into the turbulent river while trying to run away from the other. He got almost drowned but managed to get out of the water in the forest and find the soldiers of the second battalion. I expected here a more impressive ending but he just walked thru the trench until he found the commander and gave him the letter. He then found the brother of Blake and told him about what had happened. Blake's brother was the worst actor in the movie. Then he sat down leaning against a tree and looked at the picture of his beloved ones. The ending was a bit too anticlimactic as I expected the commander to not comply with the orders and even more but everything went a bit too smooth. All in all I enjoyed it especially the two lance corporals and their acting skills as they are spot-on casts.\"},\n",

Everything I saw told me that film should be fantastic and that's what I was worried about. Had I built up an opinion of the film before even seeing it? Would I only focus on the one shot cinematography?So by the time I sat down in a full cinema a few weeks into the film's release I was a bit nervous about the end result. Thankfully I didn't need to worry. Every exception was met and then some. I was in awe of the cinematography but I was certainly not distracted. It served the film excellently. There were some beautiful images to be enjoyed coupled with some of the most tender moments to come out of a horrific war film. The rise and fall of the score kept up with the scenes being laid before us and it's true that George MacKay was utterly brilliant.The performance of his was brilliant and I fear it was outshone by the rest of the noise about the film. None the less he pulled off a difficult and demanding role that I'm sure kept the audience on the edge of their seats to holding back tears in the final moments.A fantastic film, not just an art film and not just a war film. Something greater has been captured here by the team the brought together 1917.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Apart from the \\'Will it, Won\\'t it win Best Picture\\', the main talking point regarding \"1917\" is the fact that it was filmed in a single take, though of course it wasn\\'t. Mendes shot the film in a number of seamless takes that give the impression the whole thing is happening in real time with only one obvious break midway through when the screen goes black to signify the passage of time from day to night; otherwise, all the events we see would seem to take place over the film\\'s two hour running time and that\\'s where my problem with the picture lies.\"1917\" is an exciting, technically brilliant picture but it\\'s also unbelievable. What happens to the characters in this film might happen to them over the course of a day or two, a week perhaps or possibly a year but what happens to George MacKay, (never really off the screen in this film), in two hours is very hard to take. Okay, perhaps I\\'m being picky; it\\'s only a film after all and what we\\'re seeing is several stories stitched together to form the events of a single day but it\\'s still a cheat, a brilliant but unnecessary display of technical virtuosity. Watching \"1917\" I kept thinking, \\'Do we really need to do something just because we can?\\' For me, \"1917\" would have been a much better film had it been done in the old-fashioned conventional way with the action spread over several days.So what\\'s it about, this \\'one-take masterpiece\\' that\\'s neither one-take nor a masterpiece? Well, to prevent a massace of around 1600 troops two young soldiers must make their way behind enemy lines and warn a particular colonel to call off a planned assault; it\\'s as simple as that and to make this an \\'exciting\\' picture all sorts of superbly filmed misfortunes befall them.You might call it a director\\'s picture since Mendes engineers everything brilliantly but it\\'s like a massive stage production with everything designed down to the tiniest detail rather than seeming in any way \\'real\\', (let\\'s just call it \\'the theatre of war\\'). It\\'s certainly a cinematographer\\'s film and Roger Deakins will justly deserve the Oscar he\\'s going to win for shooting it and in the case of George MacKay you might even say it\\'s an actor\\'s picture. He\\'s superb and on the strength of this alone I predict a real future for him, (otherwise too many well-known faces flit across the screen in the manner of \"Oh, What a Lovely War\" or \"The Longest Day\"). Of course, a lot of people have been blown away by it or maybe they\\'ve just been blown away by the hype. Personally, I didn\\'t buy it.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'What happened to the Sam Mendes, from works of substance like \\'American Beauty\\' and \\'Road to Perdition\\' to somewhat juvenile, empty of soul films like \\'1917\\', where deep characters and real emotions are subverted for theme rides. Here, of all subjects to use for a theme ride, \"the Great War\" is a vehicle for an action adventure, fantasy-esque quest, that not only sheds little about the horrific war itself, but sanitises the sacrifice of young men by a corrupt elite on both sides of the war, who profited heavily from their demise. But you might say, \"Elcid, this is a popcorn action flick, you got to switch off your brain mate, enjoy the ride...\", yet even for mindless action, I never felt at the edge of my seat, and all of the meant-to-be tense and gripping scenes felt forced and contrived, and you could see the actors reacting to cues rather then immersed into Sam\\'s world of make believe. There are two truly great scenes in \\'Children of Men\\' (Alfonso Cuarón), both near the beginning and near the end, where the action takes place in one shot, and here the veracity of both the characters and their environment is so powerful that you truly feel immersed and haunted by the scenes. In interviews, Mendes says he was inspired by these scenes, but it seems by trying to emulate them, he has missed a trick - to justify the story within them! Therefore it feels like you are watching someone else play a video game, where the main protagonist has 9 Lives and reaches number 8 before he succeeds to the final level boss - an underwhelming encounter with Benedict Cumberbiatch (sic) who says \"foff\" and the audience foff too, to recollect on a lost 2 hours. The score by Thomas Newman is also misplaced and passé - think a Hans Zimmer rendition of Lord of the Rings\\'. The only redeeming feature is the cinematography by Roger Deakins, yet even here, it inevitably draws comparison to the superior cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki (\\'Children of Men\\'), and whilst it is interesting to purely admire the technical achievement and continuous mis-en-scene in one shot (with hidden cuts), I think such a scheme ultimately ends up stealing the emotional veracity from the characters since we never really get up close and personal to them to see their eyes - their windows to the soul. The distance makes for a mute joy ride, and it is a shame as rather then free Deakins to bring out the best in the visuals, the one-shot idea has constrained him. There is to my knowledge only two great audio-visual works on WW1 and they are Blackadder Goes Forth (TV Series) and \\'Paths of Glory\\' (Kubrick), alongside great films about all wars, from \\'Full Metal Jacket\\' to \\'Apocalypse Now\\', \\'Catch 22\\', \\'Salvador\\', \\'The Battle of Algiers\\', to name but a few.'},\n",

This sometimes includes pretending I didn\\'t pick up on a flaw, an error, a bad performance, or an implausibility.However, after I slept on it and reflected on these things, I had to change my mind, and I just could not ignore the glaring flaws, which were somewhat juvenile and made it feel like the movie was written by a 12-year old.There are numerous scenes in this movie (and they are the ones that are supposed to be the \\'most dramatic\\' and \\'intense\\') that are actually implausible to the point that they can be ridiculed and mocked at how unrealistic they are. In fact, you can actually laugh at them, despite the movie taking these scenes so seriously. It tries to sell itself or pawn itself off as some realistic, gritty take on WWI (and it \"almost\" succeeds, and it does hit the mark at scarce moments), but you can\\'t help but notice that simultaneously it also feels like some kind of unrealistic action movie with maybe Schwarzenegger as its lead since the main actor has laughable plot armor on him.Does it suffice for a new war movie for 2019? Sure, if you want to see a new war movie, then this will give you that genre. And yes, the cinematography is undeniably well-done and at times a marvel to look at.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'In a film landscape where Marvel movies are understood by many as masterpieces, and true art films are so connivingly dissected that nothing is above some reproach, a film such as 1917 makes perfect sense. I have read film critics copiously bandy about the descriptor \"immersive\" when attempting to justify effusive praise for this film the same way \"pathos\" is and has been inevitably invoked to describe the films of Charlie Chaplin. I suppose \"immersive\" does seem like a good fit in a film with a singular linear narrative; on the other hand, with such simple storytelling at play, were 1917 not \"immersive,\" it would be an utter failure.Amidst the height of the First World War, two British soldiers, lance-corporals Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George McKay), are sent on a dangerous mission to deliver a message to another regiment that will stop a battle and save the lives of 1,600 men, one of whom is Blake\\'s brother. As they battle the clock, their perilous trek through filthy rat-infested trenches and across enemy territory littered with booby traps is filled with high drama rendered ultra-realistically and seemingly captured in real time. Along the way, others that enter and exit the story in small but memorable cameos give the narrative a context and depth that profiles more than mere characters, but the time in which they lived and the war they volunteered to fight and even die for.If many of these elements seem somehow familiar, that is because they are. Though undeniably \"immersive\", 1917 is more than anything else derivative. Make no mistake, this is an exceptional movie, although there is no way it could ever be described as exceptionally original. The heavily praised continuous take presentation has a deep and long precedent, originating with Alfred Hitchcock\\'s 1948 film Rope, and most successfully executed with Birdman in 2014. The plot, though based upon true stories told to writer/director Mendes by his WWI veteran grandfather, bears more than passing resemblance to story elements from Saving Private Ryan. Many other film techniques and depictions may only be generously described as homages to Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now.So does this lack of originality make 1917 a bad film? By no means. The acting is superb and effortless, the music stirring, the cinematography and editing nothing less than brilliant. Does this set a new high watermark for technical film quality? You bet. Writer/Director Sam Mendes has never made a bad film, and here he just may have assembled a perfect one, constructed of the best parts of many other successful films before it.I suppose in a film culture saturated with countless sequels, prequels, reboots, and reimaginings, this is the new normal. In that context, for better or worse, 1917 is the state of the art.'},\n",

This has to be acknowledged as nothing short of incredible.I don't condone war & do not adhere to the propaganda of war either, but some of the greatest films ever made have been based on events that without war, could never have existed & that would be a shame... The story here is quite eventful & most couldn't even begin to imagine the sheer horror of being tasked with such a journey through enemy territory, filled with skirmishes & dangers above & around you, never mind just the idea of being there. This film manages to put you right in the thick of how manic, eerie & horrific everything could be & does it superbly.Definately in my top war epic list, up there with Apocolypse Now, Platoon & Full Metal Jacket etc. It's not the same kind of war film but worthy of the list.9/10 - 1917 is the best I've seen in years.\"},\n",

They withdrew 9 miles in this case and the Allies assumed it was a ruse. So the story is about two soldiers attempting to warn their comrades that it is not a ruse....that the Germans have simply withdrawn to the much stronger Hindenburg line. One of the best WW1 movies I have seen in many years.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 has some of the best cinematography seen on film, bar none. This film is directed by Skyfall-director, Sam Mendes, but the real star is Roger Deakins, the man behind the camera. The entire presentation of the film is so unique and so hypnotizing to watch. This movie takes the Birdman approach and tries to make the entire film look like it was filmed all in one take. The fact that they took this approach with a war film of all things is commendable, and it paid off quite spectacularly. So many moments in the film left me speechless and left me marveled at the filmmaking.The acting, soundtrack and mood of the film were also excellent. Even though this is a war movie, there are lots of quiet moments in the film, and the stellar set design and soundtrack take center stage. These moments add lots of tension and atmosphere, which better lets the viewer put themselves in the world.My only complaint with the film is that the characters feel somewhat underdeveloped. They are very likeable, and I enjoyed seeing their journey and following them, but they do not feel very three-dimensional. This was fine for me because a movie like 1917 is more about the experience of feeling like you're in a war, and it accomplished that, but a little more character moments could have helped.Overall, this was a very excellent and unique experience that I feel will be remembered for years to come as a true technical marvel. It is definitely worth a watch.\"},\n",

They travel through British trenches, No-Man's Land, allegedly deserted German trenches, countryside and ruined towns which have been, and may still be, the subject of German depredations.This is a high concept movie - an extraordinarily simple idea, but told with extraordinary style. The film is constructed as, essentially, a single unbroken take with a constantly moving camera. It is not unique in this, but it does it extremely well and the approach is ideally suited to the material.The film looks impressive, the acting is first rate, the realisation of the trenches and war-torn locales is fantastic, and the sense of being in constant danger is constant.It is nearly a masterpiece.For me, it failed in two respects. One was the artifice itself. It was so cleverly constructed that I was constantly aware of the planning which must have gone into choreographing the action and camera movements and edit points. The other was that there were a number of elements which failed to work, the woman and child, and the singing soldier to name but two.Nonetheless, it is a film which is well worth seeing.\"},\n",

Brilliantly directed by Sam Mendes, the film is everything you would want it to be. At times the pacing may seem to take a dip, but the emotional impact of the characters, is more than enough for you to stick around. The film is also shot beautifully, and makes for by far the most engaging film to grace the screen this year. All actors involved truly give it their all, and all characters seem to truly not only look real but feel real as well. In the end, 1917 is by far a technical achievement, but is also unlike anything we have seenn before in this genre, and is more than able to hold itself to that.\\nMy Rating: 9.75/10'},\n",

Since when we lower our standard for a masterpiece. Aside from cinematography, this movie has 2 things I don't enjoy: terrible acting and lots of plot holes.Tom was so eager to deliver the message to save his brother battalions at first, but only 5mins later got himself into a relax adventure into German trench and tunnel, like a kid enjoying the games, suddenly forgot about his mission. Right after they discovered the tunnel, everything becomes so silly and unrealistic: the barn, the plane, Tom was stabbed and died after like literally 5min and a split second later there's whole British company appears, which should have some medics to save him LOL, in reality. The truck only carries Schofield 500meters to a bridge which only has 1 snipper. The night scene is even more ridiculous, where the whole German army was 100m from the bridge, where the whole British company trucks passed by in the afternoon, without any conflicts. Then some stupid and silly shooting scenes which I find funny instead of intense at all. Then jumping to the river, which should've killed the guy, and fell down the fall, which should've killed him again, look at the strong and spiral currents, the hero still managed to keep his head up and float all the time. If you notice further, the water after the fall is too silent and to be true, normally after a fall like that the current is still very strong. Then hero meets battalion, only like 200m from German army in the town, but the British battalions are attacking Germans in the OTHER direction, which basically means the British is under siege haha.Time and space in this movie is completely unrealistic and doesn't make any sense. I feel unsatisfied and disappointed after watching this. Speaking about war scenes, It can never be compared to Saving Private Ryan or Band of brothers, The Pacific..\"},\n",

Director Sam Mendes is trying to achieve something with his direction, long camera shot continuation, and a wonderful music score by Thomas Newman. The film does well in capturing the realism and raw tone of war. The silence in walking through a mineshaft. The enemy firing at you and hearing the bullet ricocheting. Or an enemy charging at you. The audience is put right next to these soldiers as they cross enemy territory.The plot follows Will and Tom as they are assigned by their captain to cross no mans land and to warn the other battalion that they are about to fall into a trap from their enemy. It is a race against time that they will have to walk a far distance in less than a day. While watching out and avoiding their enemy.Director Sam Mendes does well in capturing a still camera shot. Mendes does not over do it like other action film directors with adding a lot of unnecessary action or explosions. He does capture the realism and raw tone of the movie. I like that he is trying to break the ground barrier with a one long continuation shot with the camera. Sure, there may be a scene cut somewhere. The editors did a great job in keeping the camera shots and direction very coherent without breaking away from a scene. It is kind of distracting. It works great with the movie. The opening scene following Will and Tom from their captain being told their assignment. To walking through the trenches around the soldiers. The cinematography by Roger Deakins did a great job in following these characters. And capturing the production set with torn down villages. Or a gritty aftermath of the battlefield with corpses on barb wires. It is just impressive. Lee Smith editing was well done in keeping the one long shot focused.The music score by Thomas Newman was beautifully done and haunting in a way. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman were also good with their characters. We learn a little about them as they talk about their history as they walk through no mans land. Plus there are other actors in here with a small appearance like Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Colin Firth, Claire Duburcq, Richard Madden, and Benedict Cumberbatch.My one issue with the film which I dislike about it is the pacing. It is nice to see a one shot sequence with the cinematography following the characters without cutting scene to another. Basically, you're with the characters every foot step they make. Which is cool and all but it does get a little slow when they walking a long way in a field or come to a complete pause.Overall, 1917 is a good war film done by Sam Mendes and his sharp beautiful direction. With a good music composer, editor, cinematography, and cast. It is one film that is worth seeing on the big screen.\"},\n",

If you missed it, purchasing the largest television you can afford is apt & necessary. After all, 1917 was made for IMAX, not iPhone. Run don't walk to view this instant classic, tick tock tick tock.\"},\n",

It starts off slow & methodically and eventually builds in tension & action until the climax near the end of the film. I wasn\\'t overly impressed with the acting, but the film does a good job of showing the horrors of trench warfare; and I must admit that some scenes were a bit over-the-top, although I guess it was based on a true story. The opening of The Reverent is still far superior for this kind of film style, but 1917 is definitely worth the watch.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This year's Best Picture Oscar nominee is a one shot (cuts hidden digitally) journey of a pair of soldiers during WWI trying to get a message to a unit about to engage in an attack which is actually a trap laying in wait. Sam Mendes (Spectre/American Beauty) has co-scripted an ambitious meditation on duty & sacrifice plunging the viewer into the horrors of trench warfare by solely focusing on these 2 comrade in arms (George Mackay, Dean Charles-Chapman) who take on this suicide mission (Chapman's brother is part of the unit they're heading to) when the odds aren't especially great. This visceral quest is felt in almost every frame as the dirt, blood & weirdly flowers engulf the screen making the experience a singular event. Yes one could argue that the sheer propensity of episodes (an enemy plane crash near one of the pair's stops, meeting up w/a French woman caring for an orphaned baby, a sniper attack which needs to be dealt with) may cause some audience members to decry 'come on!' but this may be the most intimate of epics put to screen so relish it while you can.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"For better or worse, 1917 is a film in which seemingly all the creative energy was focused on its technical elements. The extremely long takes are impressive, the fluid shot compositions arresting, the sets beautifully realized and convincing. But once that initial sense of awe inevitably wanes, it becomes naggingly clear that the film has nothing to offer beyond its visual splendor. It plays like a theme park ride, stringing together setpieces that offer superficial thrills but ultimately fail to engage on any emotional or intellectual level. It appears to be going for a hyperrealistic, you-are-there experience but never comes close to capturing any real sense of chaos or pandemonium. Everything feels too tightly-controlled and manicured to translate as the real thing, especially with the conspicuous direction constantly drawing attention to itself. It doesn't help either that the film seems to have an inflated sense of self-importance, as if all the theatrics are in service to some grand commentary on humanity, friendship, life, and death. In reality, it's a popcorn film that fancies itself a fine work of art, ultimately lacking in any real thematic or emotional depth. That isn't necessarily a bad thing; if you're primarily looking for a visual spectacle you're likely to be satisfied. If that's the case, I'd even recommend it. I fully applaud the effort and skill it took to make, though wish I could say it was in service to something more than killing two hours nursing your calorie-dense snack of choice.Solid 2.5/5\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Review:\\nNow I know that a lot of people think that this is a cinematic masterpiece and that Sam Mendes deserves every award under the sun, but I personally think that it is just a toned-down version of Saving Private Ryan with some dull actors. There are some A-listers popping in and out of the film, but the main character, Schofield (George MacKay) didn\\'t have any screen charisma. I know that it was made to look like it was one shot, which was extremely clever, and an amazing achievement from Sam Mendes, but I personally think that the film wasn\\'t anything that we haven\\'t seen before. I appreciate the amazing effort that was put into the timing of each scene, which must have been difficult to achieve because of the flow of the film, but from an entertainment point of view, I did drift off a couple of times. If they had put an actor in the same category as Tom Hanks, then I would have agreed with the critics and a lot of the viewers, but I honestly can say that I wasn\\'t in a rush to watch the movie again, once it had finished. It felt like a bit of an anti-climax when Schofield reached his destination, after everything that he had been through, and Cumberbatch made it clear how he felt about his presence. That\\'s the main difference between this film and Saving Private Ryan. They actually fought together to get out of the mess they were in, once they reached their destination. I know that Schofield saved many life\\'s by delivering the message but I was expecting fireworks at the end. Anyway, I\\'ll give Sam Mendes props for the cinematography, but there are better war films out there. Watchable!Round-Up:\\nThis movie was directed by Sam Mendes, who also brought you American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Jarhead, Away We Go, Skyfall and Spectre. 1917 won an Oscar for Cinematography, Visual Effects and Sound Mixing, along with a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Original Score and Best Director. It was tipped to win the Best Picture Oscar, but it was beaten at the post by Parasite, which I am yet to see. It was inspired by Sam Mendes grandfather\\'s experiences in WWI: \"The Autobiography of Alfred H. Mendes 1897-1991\", so it really came from the heart. It took the actors 6 months to rehearse the movie, mainly because of the timing of the shoots, and with over 40 awards for cinematography, it\\'s clear that it\\'s getting recognition, more for the filming than the content.Budget: $95million\\nWorldwide Gross: $384millionGenre: Drama, War\\nCast: George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Daniel Mays, Colin Firth, Pip Carter, Andy Apollo, Paul Tinto, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch. 5/10'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This is something like a more traditional (and thus for my taste better) version of Dunkirk. The film is as much about what time means in light of death as it is about The Great War. It has an operatic scope. The storyline is sparse and the dialog spartan. But the characters are more clearly defined in this film than Dunkirk. There is a stronger central plot and a better sense of narrative momentum. If you hated Dunkirk but thought maybe the concept could work this is a film to see.In any case I still found the film too technique driven to fully work. The film consists of long takes stitched together to form almost one continuous shot for the entire film. (There is one visible cut in the film, the rest are hidden). This technique-to various degrees-has been used several times already-usually to a better effect. You get it for comedic tone in The Player and Birdman. You also have it used for building tension about survival in Gravity. You have it for meditative effect it The Revenant or for that matter for a shot in Atonement. You have the time thematic application of it in Russian Ark. Having seen this trick a few times now how and where the cuts are hidden can be obvious. I found Mendes' use of the technique distracting. I spent much of the film looking for the seams. In any case I didn't find the long take all that immersive. To often the way the camera switches its general location-i.e. from behind the actors to in front-broke the atmosphere of the film by calling attention to the fact it was a film. It ended up feeling all a little staged.It is a pity. Several sequences are well put together. The two main performances are quite good. The film works in fits and starts. When it works it really works. When it doesn't it really doesn't.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Let me just take a deep breath... Wait, one more... Uff, I have no idea how I survived this IMAX screening of 1917. Usually, I don\\'t delve deep into technical stuff since most people don\\'t know or don\\'t care about these attributes, but it\\'s impossible not to address Roger Deakins\\' cinematography. It\\'s not the first time a film has been edited to appear as \"one shot\" (a continuous take), but it never fails to impress me.Alejandro G. Iñárritu\\'s Birdman, Silent House starring Elizabeth Olsen, or the famous Rope from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock... all produce the same trick. Even Mr. Robot and The Haunting of Hill House have brought us two phenomenal \"one shot\" episodes, edited as well with the so-called \"stitches,\" meaning that the actual cuts are made to look invisible to the viewer, hence giving that feeling that it\\'s all just one continuous take. Cuts are often applied when a random character is passing in front of the camera; when the latter \"pans\" (movement similar to a head-turn) over a wall or an object that occupies the whole screen; or when the characters are simply going through a dark area.Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith (editor) all work together to deliver the most immersive war movie (probably) ever. Yes, it has a simple premise, and the main narrative is basic, but the remarkable technical achievement elevates this film so freaking much. Even if you don\\'t know the slightest thing about filmmaking or how movies are made, it\\'s impossible to watch this film and not think \"something feels different about this one.\" This is a movie meant to be watched at the biggest, best screen possible. Watching 1917 at home on a TV or a laptop is not going to work at all.Throughout the whole runtime, I felt like I was there with Schofield and Blake. It feels like we are a third soldier going with them on a vital mission to save thousands of lives. I believe 1917 is the best \"one shot\" film to date (I\\'ve been using the quote signs for a reason, don\\'t mistake it for an actual one shot movie), with Birdman as a close second. If the latter deals with a lot more dialogue and acting, the former has dozens of nail-biting sequences featuring shootouts, explosions, and a lot of running/walking/swimming through mud, dead corpses, blood, and way too many nasty rats.I really have no words to describe Roger Deakins\\' cinematography. It\\'s not merely a film, it\\'s a whole experience. It\\'s not just another cool technical achievement. It\\'s the entire foundation of 1917, and the main reason why so many people are rushing to the theater. However, a lot of people are completely ignoring Lee Smith\\'s work. Don\\'t forget, this isn\\'t an actual one shot movie. If it\\'s been edited to look like one continuous take, and if it actually does appear to be a single take, then the editor should get as much recognition as everyone else. Yes, he doesn\\'t have to work with thousands of cuts (I counted 14, but I\\'m sure there\\'s more), but they still exist, and he has to make sure no one feels them. And he did so perfectly.My last paragraph concerning the technical aspects has to go to Sam Mendes and Thomas Newman. As the director, Mendes is able to deliver precisely what he envisioned and seamlessly coordinate his actors. Not only has he directed my favorite Bond film (Skyfall), but he also offers one of my favorite war movies of all-time. As for Newman, I just wish that Joker had been released in another year because 1917\\'s score is fantastic. Hildur Guðnadóttir is likely taking the Oscar for Best Original Score, but if Thomas Newman takes it, I\\'ll still be delighted.A lot of comparisons are being made with Christopher Nolan\\'s Dunkirk. They\\'re similar films regarding the fact that their main goal is to provide the most immersive war experience. Story and character-wise, both movies don\\'t really develop that much. Nolan\\'s film is loved by most critics and audiences all around the world, but one common complaint about it is the lack of character building. I didn\\'t mind that at all because the movie never actually tried to make their characters important. They were just soldiers caught in the worst of situations, similar to 1917. However, I do think the latter does a better job of making us care for the protagonists.George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman\\'s characters have small arcs, but they exist. In the beginning, Blake is the emotional-driven character, while Schofield seems to be the rational one. We, as the audience, care about the mission first, but as time goes by, we learn about their personal traits and motivations. By the end of the film, I was crying. Both play off of each other really well, but it\\'s their dialogue that impresses me the most. What seems to be just a random talk while strolling through an open field of grass, it truly isn\\'t. If it\\'s not meaningful at the time, it\\'s going to be. The acting is more physical than anything, and both deliver outstanding performances.I would say I love 1917 as much as I love Dunkirk. I might be tempted to choose the former due to the \"recency effect,\" but there\\'s one small aspect that negatively affects both. Their replay value is not as high as other films since their technical achievements don\\'t work as well on a regular TV in the comfort of our own home. You will never feel or understand that \"immersive experience\" that everyone talks about. You won\\'t know what made people to be blown away. You won\\'t love it as much as everyone else. So, please, do NOT miss 1917 in theaters!Sam Mendes, Roger Deakins, and Lee Smith. Director, director of photography, editor. Three key filmmaking roles in the creation of one of the best WWI movies of all-time. Edited to look like one continuous shot, 1917 is a mind-blowing technical achievement, elevated by Deakins\\' always jaw-dropping cinematography, Thomas Newman emotionally powerful score, Mendes impeccable directing, and Smith\\'s seamless editing. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman deliver outstanding (physical) performances, but it\\'s the astonishing filmmaking that steals the spotlight. Production design, costume design, sound, you name it. Everything is absolutely perfect. It\\'s meant to be seen at the biggest screen near you since this is an incredibly immersive experience that you won\\'t get at home. It\\'s going straight into my Top10: Best Movies of 2019, and I hope you\\'ll love it as much as I do.Rating: A'},\n",

Those words, \"fighting,\" and \"trenches\" take on heightened meaning through astounding sets and dynamic cinematography as a camera gets at eye level through what feels like a non-stop race in tight, miserable quarters. Starting with a command to get from one side to the other as quickly as possible, the camera rolls forward with hardly a stop, pushing action forward clearly but without a break in a phenomenal example of why the root word \"move\" create the term \"movie.\" 1917 runs in the long war-related tradition of a Greek athlete at Marathon or the tension created for Australians at Gallipoli. With instructions to deliver a vital message to avert further battlefield debacles, two soldiers in the movie 1917 rush forward, carrying written orders from their commander. But forget any well-groomed trail or convenient running garb; they deal with the worst of man and nature, with no assurance of success even if they get their message to its destination. Little-known actors George MacKay and Dean Charles Chapman display the youth and energy required in their lead roles; the more familiar faces of Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Richard Madden from Game of Thrones step in for remarkably brief moments, signaling that everyone wants to work with a director as good as Sam Mendes. Rightfully so; in exploring a couple of days in the year 1917, Mendes creates one of the best films released in 2019.'},\n",

Director Sam Mendes utilizes a first-person perspective, not unlike the one often used in computer games, which gives these two messengers' story an incredible intensity and urgency. It's as if we're experiencing WWI ourselves, both the tactics and bravery, but also the brutality, randomness, and not least meaninglessness of this unprecedentedly bloody war. The story itself is a simple one, which makes Mendes' ingenious, flawless direction even more meritable. Strong performances by the two young leads add to the emotional effect.\"},\n",

The main character is very well acted and is able to portray the emotions and strain of war. The film is one continuous shot which is very impressive. It also shows all the horrors of the war. One of the best scenes shows the soldiers going over the top as the character runs along the front line. One very small criticism is that the main character is shot at a lot but a lot of bullets miss him even though the German soldiers are quite close to him. The main character is able to shoot a German in a tower from quite a long distance. This is because the main character has to be put in danger but obviously he can't die before his mission is over or the film would be over. When his mission is done there is very little recognition for the main characters journey which adds to the realism as the commanding offices have a lot of other issues to deal with which adds to the realism. The music is very good and the film looks very realistic. There is one scene with a plane crash which is very well done. Overall, this film is a brilliant portrayal of World War 1. There are a lot of World War 2 films but not many World War 1 films so this helps to address that. It may be too graphic for schools but it could be shown to show how awful the conflict was.\"},\n",

(R)Two British soldiers (MacKay, Chapman) are given the task of delivering a message across enemy lines to halt an attack that would cost over a thousand lives. Director Mendes\\' WWI drama cares naught for the politics or grand theater of war, choosing instead to focus on two individuals undertaking one mission covering less than twenty-four hours, with the camera ceaselessly following them in real time. That faux-continuous \"single shot\" gimmick is a distracting one, especially in the early-going; Roger Deakins\\' photography is sublime as expected, and the technical mastery is undeniable (though some of the edit points are hardly seamless), but the technique trivializes character dimension and the economy of rhythm for the sake of raw, limited experience. Designed to give the viewer a down-and-dirty, firsthand look at the experiences of soldiers, never exceeding its scope beyond what the main characters can see or anticipate, but also never escaping the labors of its own ritual--visually spellbinding at times, appropriately stark and grimy, yet never fully immersive or emotionally engaging. The leads do solid work with little meat written onto the bones besides exhaustion, fear and determination; small roles for recognizable faces do little besides provide faces to recognize.67/100'},\n",

Though the director admittedly used editing tricks to achieve this, it makes no difference as the viewing experience is greatly enhanced by this filmmaking choice. The entire film really does feel like a gripping rollercoaster with only very brief periods of coasting, or rest.

It failed to show the absolute horror of world war 1. It failed to show the grime and dirt, the desperation in the men, of fighting this war of attrition.This is going to be a bit of rant review, because I was intensely excited for a WW1 movie, and general reviews (I didn't really want to spoil myself with more in depth stuff) were very positive.First of the grit, it seems like they didn't want to show the true horror of this war except through either some dead bodies or injured people in the medical bay. The full last ''action'' scene in particular was something that almost felt PG rated. I'm not asking to see legs flying everywhere, but gore is a part of war, especially the first one. And it missed the mark, why I take the biggest offense from because WW1 was ****** horrific. One of the worst wars in history.But that aside, the characters, William, a soldier that a care about why? They added a little personality to his mate that died, and that was a emotional and unexpected scene for sure. But then we just travel around with this empty shell of a human being. Which I guess, his journey was wanting to die in the war but after telling that brother and seeing his mate die, he realized he didn't want to. But It felt so unsatisfying.With the other people I went with we all agreed we didn't care for the character at all. We just weren't invested in what'll happen to him. And to be honest, I really was expecting him to die, to make fulfill that empty feeling and show the true side of war, but it ended with a happy ending..I guess.Another thing, those germans must be really stupid. A british soldier avoiding multipule german encampments, being spotted by flares. With that flare scene just being a ''cool visuals'' scene in the end. They never chased him down, we barely even saw them for that matter. Seemed like no one really cared for this one enemy soldier, even though everytime we meet a german they want to skin these guys alive seemingly.This leads to the scene with the woman and the baby, he gives food, and leaves, but again.. character development? What was the point of that scene?And wow, just the final scene once he delivers the orders, first he was told to get out, but being persistent he reads them, and okay.. call the men back. That's it? That's what I watched this journey for? No view of the germany's response or from the brits?Pfff.. I can go on, I'll leave it at this.6/10 for cinematography and visuals. The rest is mediocre and I would not recommend friends to spend money on this movie.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Much reminds me about Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk here - in that they're both war films which technically stunning, but are also laced with heart and soul. The cinematography will prove to be a high point in the career of Roger Deakins - a career littered with more remarkable achievements than most working in any area of film. Somehow he conjured images and moment of striking beauty, nightmarish hellscapes, touching intimacy - all without sacrificing the narrative propulsion which the apparent one-take style serves; we're left with the sense that this story is but one part of an endlessly, relentlessly flowing river which is sweeping a whole generation mercilessly along.Remarkable though his work is, it's not just Deakins' achievements that should be mentioned. The visual effects are more or less faultless; Thomas Newman's omnipresent score is startling; the story itself replete with razor-wire tension, humanity and emotion. It all manages to evoke the hell of war without giving in to the increasingly tiresome war-is-hell cinema clichés we've grown so accustomed to.What's rarely mentioned are the two central performances by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, perfectly understated enough to draw us in and take us into the heart of ordinary people caught up in events no one should ever have to experience.1917 is a brilliant, exhausting, thrilling, moving achievement to stand alongside Dunkirk to make a pair of modern war films that will stand as pillars of the genre.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Never have the trenches of World War One been so tidy -- never have the ruined walls and arches that surround them been so picturesquely arranged -- never have the fingernails of the soldiers been so clean, their teeth so straight and white, their hair so artfully mussed. Even the rats looked like extras who had wandered in from a live action remake of Ratatouille. Did the filmmakers not see Peter Jackson's They Shall Not Grow Old? About fifteen minutes in my wife and I knew with a certainty that one of the handsome chaps would not go the distance, and once the remaining handsome chap was on his own we knew with an even greater certainty that he would meet a cowering French peasant girl in a barn or cellar, and that she would be clutching an infant while shells exploded overhead, and sure enough, about forty minutes later, there she was, fresh from having her tumbling golden curls blown out at a good salon. We relished the interiors of the buildings in the ruined town, where patches of brick showed through the plaster walls with all the gritty realism of the decor of a 1950's Italian restaurant in Newark. And to yank us out of the movie right when we might have been giving over to it in spite of ourselves, cameos by Patrick Melrose and Robb Stark! Gorgeous technical work by Roger Deakins and team gets this a couple of stars. On Oscar night that will be the wife and me me rolling my eyes when this wins best picture.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is a film which undoubtedly would have been ear marked for awards right from it's conception. The good news is that the film delivers on this potential. I'd be very surprised if it didn't win the Oscar for Cinematography and must have a good chance of taking away a few other gongs.The film is set in the trenches of world war one. It tells the story of 2 men who are tasked with delivering a message to the commanding officer of another battalion. The film really conveys just how awful conditions were for the troops involved in the trenches. The film gives the effect of being one take, but there are significantly different scenes along the way. Blake (Dean Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are the soldiers tasked with delivering the message. They are excellent in the roles and aren't actors that I'm familiar with. None of the other actors have significant screen time, so if you are going along to see one of your favourites, don't expect them to be in it for long.1917 is an engrossing film and well worth seeing on the big screen.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This film is a masterpiece. The camerawork is brilliant as many others have noted. Wonderfully paced, never feels slow or boring. The two main actors are extremely compelling, and George McKay absolutely knocks it out of the park. Simple facial expressions of his can convey 10 emotions at once. You are so relieved when he is finally able to complete his mission at the last moment, and you can feel his relief.This film is not based on a true story, instead it is very loosely based on stories told to Sam Mendes by his grandfather. Nevertheless, it brings to light several truths of war. The fact that many of these soldiers were barely men, terrified and lost, more than capable of empathy but often forced to do the hard thing. Forced to consider the extreme lengths the enemies and even themselves may go to, even during events that in the grand scheme of war are simply blips. (The scene with the German pilot is a good example)This is a film that has stuck with me for years and I never tire of it. Absolutely 10/10 and I would recommend it to anyone.'},\n",

But, all in all, there wasn't much for the actors to work with in regards to character development.The visuals suffered early on for many seconds vs the requirement it be in real time as it ended up with dead time, which is very long on screen, even if it's seconds.A very horrible air to it, too, as it went along.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This movie is being shilled by the studio and producers. Any negative review is being brigaded. I liked American Beauty, but Mendes looks like the bully-type and they are probably sensitive since they have high profit-hopes for this to rebound after the GG. A 100 million dollar budget and the film only grossed about 2.5 million in the US..Questions:The camera work is awesome, but be warned this is not a great war movie. It's an average war movie with major flaws. The entire scenario isn't even sensical or plausible; like other people have said- if it was so important, why not fly a plane to reach them? Why weren't these two somewhat inexperienced soldiers protected and accompanied by at least a few more soldiers if it was so important? Why were the two soldiers so clean-cut and clean-shaven that they looked like female primadonnas in the middle of WWI? Why would they dumbly and naively try to save an enemy pilot without caution to the point one of them is stabbed (were they not trained properly in boot camp and the military?). Why are they so alone and isolated on the farm, but just so conveniently suddenly after the one of them dies, another battalion happens to show up immediately at that moment (for one-take, one-shot continuity, of course)? Why is the commander of the big battle so easy to reach by an unknown subordinate who hasn't proven to be trustworthy? Why is the soldier who prevails beyond the pilot saving scene so impervious to bullets and gunfire- is he Rambo or Commando? (He doesn't look like it). Why does it happen that the one little room he hides out in in the middle of such a horrific war has this perfectly made up young female with a baby in it (Oh and slap yourself in the head that you didn't think of it- yes, the milk he got from the farm is just so perfectly arranged to be used here; could you be manipulated for sentimentalism any more?). Why did the soldier who was chasing him just decide to give up when he jumped in the river? Why in the final scene are bombs landing all around him as he foolishly runs above the bunker, but he doesn't get a scratch on him? Why didn't the brother look anything like the other one, and why when he was told to look at the casualty area was the other brother perfectly unscathed?Again, the camera work is outstanding, acting suffices, but some of the scenes and writing is downright implausible and almost funny. Was there a GG sympathy award handed to this to help it at the box office or with viewership by giving it recognition or something? It's a decent movie, but other than cinematography, it's not award-worthy on that high of a level.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Beautiful cinematography by Roger Deakins. The scene at night in the ruins that are lit by flares and fire is fantastic. Two simple shots stand out to me; the first being in the beginning when the two protagonists walk around a body of water and the camera parts from them, goes to the waters surface and follows them from the side as they cross. The second being when Schofield sits to listen to the solider sing to his compatriots. The camera weaves in between the crowd of listeners to come back on Schofield. Very good costumes. Great set design and dressing. The film is filled with soldiers dirtied in the trenches; smoking, drinking, sleeping and tending to wounds. Locations are filled with ruins, craters, barred wire, old posters, fires, rubble and dead bodies. Everything in the foreground and background does a great job to feel like an authentic WW1 movie. The one shot element does a great job helping convey passage of time as well as really make the movie feel like one continuous journey. All the events on the way to the destination are great and exciting to watch. The death of Blake served as a great way to create stakes very shortly into the movie's runtime as well a create a good character moment between Schofield and Blake's brother. The last 25 minutes or so are great. The quick tempo ticking score gives a sense of urgency.There are a few elements that really hinder 1917. The first being the dialogue. A lot of the time it's very cheese ball, conversations between the two protagonists seem off. The second is the actual story. There's really nothing to the story, just a simple get from point A to point B with things that happen in the middle. Next is the one take element. Scenes where Schofield is running from Germans firing at him seem not as tense as they should be. Well over a dozen shots are missed back to back to back and you see every single one because its one take. Some quick cuts during those scenes would have created a more tense feeling. Finally the movie seemed more like a performance, like a play.Pretty good war movie that is really elevated by its cinematography and attention to detail on set, with a couple great moments. If you like war movies this is one to watch.\\n7.5/10\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"It's a solid 8/10 war movie but it has problems, the biggest of which is: There's several times in this movie where the main character makes IDIOTIC choices, which directly disadvantage him and puts himself and others into peril. It's honestly poor writing, for the sake of building the drama/suspense... but having the main character in your movie make stupid descisions simply to raise the suspense level is a very scummy writing tactic because the writer hopes that the viewer won't notice it (sorry, but I noticed).As far as the plot goes, it's a good plot, although the main character being a pacifist is dumb and honestly the movie would have been much better if they made the main character not be a pacifist... I mean, it's a battlefield in World War 1, so why would you make your main character a pacifist? I don't really object to it, I just know that the movie would have been better if he actually used his gun a bit more, but hey, they chose to make him a pacifist so it results in a movie with less action and thus in my opinion it's a more boring movie.And the 'one long shot' gimic is done adequately though it's not as good as Birdman (2014), and you can very easily see the moments that the next scene starts because there's always something passing between the field of focus and the camera (that's when you know a cut was made). Anyway, it's a cool gimic which is executed adequately but not executed as well as in Birdman.There's also 2 large plot-holes at 1hr2mins into the movie... Without spoiling anything, I'll just say: Why would the german target 1 lone guy, instead of a whole squad? In real war, any soldier would have JUMPED at the opertunity to shoot as many enemy soldiers as he could... And the 2nd plot-hole here is that it is exactly 55sec from the time that they dropped him off, until the first gunshot goes off, and in 55sec they would be MAYBE 800meters away from him (assuming they drove at 50km/h, which is being generous for army trucks on mud roads), so they would absolutely have heard the gunshots, and would have turned around to render aid to him, which would have changed the course of the entire movie.Overall, it's a good war movie and it'll keep you entertained for 1hr50mins. There ARE better war movies out there, like Fury (2014) or Saving Private Ryan (1998) which are both 10/10 movies, but this one is still a fine war movie at 8/10.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"It's been a while since Sam Mendes's last feature film. Spectre was quite a disappointment but I'm sure that 1917 will be a definite crowdpleaser.1917 follows two British soldiers who are assigned a task to deliver a message in order to stop 1,600 men from dying.Like Birdman, the main selling point is how the entire film looks like it's been shot in one single take. Through long demanding long takes and clever editing, the makers were able to achieve this. Whilst Birdman was shot in a very small area, 1917 traverses through many different locations which makes it really difficult to achieve the goal they were going for. What we got in the end is nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. You never feel bored since the location and action that takes place feel extremely real. This movie acts like a VR game as it genuinely feels like you are there with them about to embark on a perilous journey that may prove to be fatal.Roger Deakens has always been my favourite cinematographer and here he gives it his all. If he wins an Oscar for Best Cinematography, I wouldn't be surprised. The way the camera moves in front and behind the characters is fantastic. There are some absolutely gorgeous shots including one with George MacKay running which is just a feast for your eyes. What impressed me the most was the use of lighting during the dark scenes. There is one which involves flares and it's incredible how Deakens lit the scene up just using that. I really have to commend Deakens and Mendes for their work here. Making a war film seem like it's done in one shot is not easy at all but they managed to do it extremely well.Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay were required to do a lot for this movie but they both gave off very believable performances. On the other hand, their characters could have been better. Through the whole film it's very hard to care about both of them since we don't learn much about them. There is a very important scene that tried to bring an emotional reaction from me but I could not feel it due to how one dimensional the characters are. If Mendes and Wilson-Cairns tried to flesh out the characters more then this film would be much better.Altogether, this is a great achievement that should be viewed in the cinemas to get the full experience. The lighting, acting and camerawork are all done with tremendous skill. 1917 could have been better in terms of its writing but the aesthetics are what make this film unique from the other war films. Roger Deakens deserves another Oscar for this film and I have no doubt he will win it.\"},\n",

Its only competition will be from The Irishman, and maybe Once Upon...

It prevents you from getting into the film and you can almost see the actors and extras have been waiting for the camera to come to them so they can do their bit. The story is flimsy and empty. Some of the sets, especially the bombed out buildings at night, are so obviously sets this even more takes you out of the film. Aside from the opening, I was aware every minute that I was watching a movie. The acting is fine though under the circumstances, the action sequences are limp and unbelievable as are many of the events that happen along the way - these mostly feel like fillers to pad the film out and many are very heavy handed visual bits that simply do not come off.\\nIt isn't a bad film by any means, but it isnt the masterpiece it is being made out to be and there are many better war films out there that do not sacrifice so much substance for style.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'The world war that was the bloodiest transition from the past into the present martial wise and one that wiped out an entire generation compelling some to claim it as the beginning of the decline of the West, World War I was ugly, sluggish, slow and pulverizingly costly. \"1917\" shows the human sacrifice involved and the camaraderie that helped many survive and endure. Two British soldiers are assigned to brave no man\\'s land in order to warn a battalion of fellow Brits not to attack as they\\'re set for a trap by their wily German foes. The ensuing drama is an odysseyan tale of tragedy, warfare, hardship, humanity, endurance and a race against time. Good acting and a ground-level view of the story bring a realism conveying the realities of war as gunfire, explosions, fistfights, blood and death take place amidst the hellish backdrop of filthy trenches, putrid water, barbed wire, craters, corpses, grimy uniforms and dazed, angry, mud-drenched soldiers who\\'ve seen it all. The only qualm I have with the film is the length. Clocking in at nearly two hours the time pushes the script to the point of tedium considering the story is very much a solitary affair that would have best been served as a short or an hour long flick. A surprise hit and nominated for several awards \"1917\" proved and showed that there is a worldwide audience for historical war films that depict war not as what people want it to be but what it truly is.'},\n",

This one is inspired by the WW1 stories told by the director\\'s grandfather. Due to his short height (5.1\"), he was usually assigned the tasks of delivering the messages, crossing German territory. Inside the German borders, the mist used to hang at about 6 feet, so he wasn\\'t visible above the mist.Thanks to the smart editing of the movie, it creates an illusion of the continuous shot. It leaves an immersive effect on spectators. You feel like you are also going inside the German borders with the two English soldiers. This movie is going to win three Oscars for sure : 1 Best movie, 2 Best Cinematography, and 3 Best sound mixing... and (Maybe, 4 Best director..)The story:\\n\"Two young British soldiers, resting under a tree, receive new orders. They are instructed to pass on a message to the troops at the front line who are planning to attack the Germans, who have retreated. The English command, however, gets to know that the German withdrawal is a tactic, an operational Trojan horse. The telephone lines are down. The two messengers must quickly traverse the dangerous ground and physically deliver the order to the fellow British troops who might charge directly into a German trap, thereby saving countless lives. Among those troops, one soldier is the elder brother of the messenger \"Lance Corporals Blake\".They go to a nerve-shattering journey: an unfortunate barbed-wire encounter, a mysterious bunker to contend with, a German warplane crash-landing, an intense clash with German soldiers during the night, and swimming through the blood-freezing water of a German river.In their dangerous mission, one of those two soldiers, Lance Corporals Blake, gets martyred.\"According to me, the most emotional scene is the conversation between the surviving messenger and the elder brother of the martyred messenger.There wasn\\'t a single person in the audience with dry eyes when the elder brother of the martyred messenger asked the surviving messenger, \"ohh!! My brother has also come! Where is he?\".'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'It runs 1917 on the French front. Two British Army corporals, William Schofield and Tom Blake (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, respectively) are sent to carry a note to stop the offensive of another English battalion on German lines that he believes are in retreat, when in fact the Germans fell back there to ambush him. A true suicide mission, stimulated however by the incentive of Blake\\'s reunion with his brother in that battalion.1917 is an astonishing immersive experience in the horrors of the trench warfare of World War I, filmed in a (almost) shot sequence that accompanies the protagonists at all times, so the film takes place practically in real time. At certain times, the warlike character gives way practically to horror movies. The anecdote, then, is minimal, as well as the characters. The power of images, sound and music (by Thomas Newman) is prodigious. Roger Deakins\\' photography (multi-award winning, as well as the film in general) is beautiful and his twists are fundamental in creating the different climates of the film. There is a nocturnal sequence that is simply anthological because of its tension, its aesthetics and the variety of feelings and sensations that it brings into play and produces.Some critics have objected to this film by the eclectic Sam Mendes two central aspects that in my opinion are virtues. One of them is that the adventures of the protagonists and the sequence shot in motion resemble the perception of the film to the experience of a video game. And will it not be the other way around? Video games simply don\\'t reflect the experience of war and especially now with its remote and virtual control aspects? The First War was a labyrinthine trench warfare.The other criticism is the lack of \"personal history\" of the protagonists, which would take away psychological depth. 1917 in this sense resembles Dunkirk: it addresses its characters in media res, that is, in the middle of the battle front. Well, I must say that this \"lack\" and the simplicity of their motivations places the protagonists in the shoes of true \"anonymous soldiers.\"1917 is one of those films that one regrets not having seen in the cinema, a cinematographic display with capital letters at the service of a war story where despair and duty go hand in hand.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I see all the \"OMG OMG 10 10\" reviews and I feel most of those people got caught up in the \"one shot\" aspect of the film, and not the film itself.Yes, the long cuts (because YES there are cuts...when the camera passes by a background object and when it cuts to black) are very awesome ...at first, but by the time the soldier gets a ride with another group of soldiers, all I kept thinking is \"ok...we could use with a few time jumps here...\" and by the time he ends up in the water, I was squirming with a desire for the fast forward button. It\\'s like watching a REALLY awesome 3-D movie...you love it, but sometimes you just wish more was done for the script and less for the stunning shots. I hesitate to use the word \"tiresome\" but yes...So my issue ...the options for modern films on WWI are very far and few between that aren\\'t low low budget ...(lost battalion is AMAZING and a better film imo) and we don\\'t really seem to get any glimpses of the horror that that war truly was (disease/pain/the water/cold/gas etc etc) and I had hoped this film would highlight some of that...but instead they went with a visual treat, which is fine...just not what I\\'d hoped for. They TRY to show you trench life, and life in the mud, but you never at any time really feel \"what a nightmare\" like Full Metal Jacket/Saving Pvt Ryan, etc etc. which again is fine. It\\'s still a well made film, with many visually awesome shots, and some very slow moments as well. The problem is I don\\'t believe any of these slow moments were intended to feel slow and boring.As long as you keep one thing in mind you\\'ll be alright. This is NOT an action movie, I\\'d dare say it\\'s not even a \"war\" movie...it\\'s about a movie set during a war is all. This film should\\'ve been marketed as a drama imo. And no I don\\'t believe you have to show heads blown off or buckets of blood to make a good war film. \"Final Journey\" is a GREAT example of a WWI film with maybe 2% of this films budget that shows the hell of that war without gore.Still a good film, but I don\\'t believe this one will one day take its place among the all time Great War films..'},\n",

It is not even a \"technical masterpiece\" like some are trying to claim, and it is about as far from a \"masterpiece\" as a movie can possibly be as a whole.Anyone calling this movie a masterpiece or one of the best war movies ever or any other malarkey like that is either flat out lying or they are teenagers or little kids who know nothing about the realities of war. The movie may appeal to them because it is shot like a \"video game\", which younger people are into.The only really truly \"great\" feature of this movie is the cinematography, and to be quite honest, the best camera work is seen in the first 20-30 minutes of the movie. Beyond that, even the outstanding camerawork begins to actually fall apart as the protagonist literally begins to \"run in circles\" around a city just so they can continue continuity on the one-take filming.It\\'s a \"good\" movie, but do not go in thinking this is a masterpiece or anything great.Imo, it is one of the most overrated movies, if not THE most overrated and overhyped movie of the last five years. It\\'s at least in the top 3-5 most overrated and overhyped. The camerawork/filming style though is definitely worth a watch.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '1917 is in itself a pretty decent action movie: tension building is well done, long tracking shots through the trenches, and even a few outstanding scenes reminiscent of the better work of Bresson, like the bridge crossing scene. However it also has several flaws, ranging from minor to more irritating. It seems the script was not well researched, and this is not Kubrick first reading several years into the subject matter, and then coming up with something perfect.First, the hierarchy as portrayed in the movie is incorrect: WWI meant strict hierarchy, it seems very unlikely orders from higher up would be ignored or reflected upon. In WWI the battle field was a reflection of society at that time, from upper to lower class. In Paths of Glory, by now the benchmark for WWI movies, we see the arrogance of the upper levels slaughtering thousands of soldiers for nothing. As Scorsese noted about Paths of Glory: \"It was so honest, that it was shocking, and what made it even more shocking, was the nature of the way it was shot, the use of the tracking camera and the trenches\".Then, the portrayal of the Germans is more WWII-like than WWI: Soldiers from Europe went to the battlefield in WWI seeing this as an honor to defend their homeland, almost like a football match. They were waved out like heroes, most were very nationalistic at that time. If you have seen the excellent Peter Jackson-documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, you noticed little hate between Germans and British. So, the stereotypical Hollywood bad German is driving the action once again in this movie. To the scriptwriters I would advice them to read a history book about the matter.Another inaccuracy is that individual ethnic soldiers are written into the script, maybe to reflect and conform with current society\\'s ethnically mixed makeup. And although groups of colonial soldiers fought in WWI, they mostly did so in their own regiments, just as society was organized then. Few of them fought as individuals in the main ethnic British group.The story contains some odd situations: Wouldn\\'t it be better for the Germans to catch Schofield alive for interrogation, he also goes through an unlikely amount of luck, and after the river scene he ends up just in the right place. The village looks by the way too much like a film set, and some other sets do not look very realistic either.Then the much discussed tracking shots. See again Paths of Glory: The tracking shots there have more tension, more dynamism, and more speed. Here they are dull. I was somewhat disappointed overall in the work of Roger Deakins here, take Sicario as an example of what this man is capable of.Mendes started his career with an almost perfect script, that was also well executed (American Beauty). Since then he thinks he is a great visual film maker, the problem however is that a guy like Nolan surpasses him in both writing and visual execution.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'People call this film \"The Birdman of WWI\" and to be fair that is a justified assessment. This entire film is filmed like it is one camera shot and it is AWESOME! think one of the most impressive thing apart from the one looking shot is the AMAZING CINEMATOGRAPHY. This shouldn\\'t be no surprising since it is the legend himself Roger Deakins (Blade Runner 2049 Cinematographer). Every scene feels like a painting and it is absolutely stunning. There is a scene at night where the lighting was done in such a creative way that heighten the tension of the scene. On that note there must also be praise for the score by Thomas Newman who somehow manages to make a score that somehow manages toe elevate every scene and help tell the story. There is also some amazing sound design that manages to make the War actually scary with moments that give horror movie jump scares a run for its money. Additionally, the props and set design should also get praise for creating such large,realistic but elaborate sets to accommodate for a more natural one shot scene. Everything in this film just feels like a technical achievement. We haven\\'t even touched on the acting or story yet but just for the way this was filmed is already engaging enough. Nevertheless, the two main actors George MacKay as Lance Corporal William \"Will\" Schofield and Dean-Charles Chapma as Lance Corporal Thomas \"Tom\" Blake manages to do a phenomenal job in showing the horror of war and giving authentic,believable characters. The story, while relatively simple, is engaging enough to keep you invested in the objective of the main characters. They must send a message to allies stop them running into a trap. It\\'s simple but works well for the aim of one shot as now it makes the audience a part of the journey.There isn\\'t much negative to this movie but I guess if I have to be quite nitpicky it is the fact that halfway through the movie there is a obvious cut. So this movie is actually really a two shot film. The cut was necessary to make the situation more desperate and allow for a unique change in scenery even though it was a bit of a jarring cut. Another sort of nitpick is that we don\\'t really get much info on the main characters. We get their names and we know what their mission is but their backstory is just given in tidbits. It goes in a Dunkirk route in which we care about these characters because of the situation they are in rather than the fact that we are invested in the characters. It can be argued that the tidbits more than gives you enough info about the characters but it\\'s really up to the audience in the end. Personally, I don\\'t find it too much of a fault but can see how others could consider it so.Honestly my negatives are just nitpicks. This movie is amazing and it is definitely worth watching right now.'},\n",

The sound mixing is perfect, with ominous \"depth tones\" to gunshots, to silence, the sound is one of 1917\\'s many perfections. I\\'m constantly amazed at how they shot the film itself to make it appear so seamless. Truly one of the best visual feasts in recent memory.Getting past the technical side, the story continues to hold up. The suspense and tension is there and truly the story itself is quite good. I really liked how it built the tension, and while we (almost) never see the enemy, it always feels as if they are right there just past the corner or beyond the ridge. It really is a great war movie, and great film just in general. There\\'s little to nothing to complain about, the cast is good, the story is as well, all the technical aspects are superb, and it all comes together to make the awesome film that is 1917.'},\n",

Technically the film is a triumph and the urgency pours through the screen. There is little time given to dwell on events and the pace is relentless, with several high budget and expertly choreographed sequences to admire. Character development and dialogue are efficient and we get an impressively long list of both establishment and newcomer British actors.\"},\n",

The cameos from several famous British faces are not distracting as some critics have claimed and you feel mild relief during these moments as if you have seen a familiar face.\\nThe two leads are very good but it is the outstanding direction that makes this the best war film I've seen.

It brings trench life, dealing with mud, dealing with rats, the perspective of the trench charge, bodies left to rot in no-man's land, and other aspects of WWI to life. 1917 has a decent story that allows the creative team to explore the life and trials of a British soldier from that time frame.\\nThe idea of having a two shot movie was interesting. While the movie was a consistent flow that focused on the two stars, it did slow the pace of the film and it limited what the story could have been - now that is saying it could have been a 9/10 story but was stuck in the mud to bring the story to a 7/8.\\nThe other downfall of the two shot movie was that there was less of an opportunity to bring the two mains to life. It felt (from a veteran's perspective) that you were watching another squad go through this experience with no investment. It still did not lower the movie, but it made you wonder how much better the film could have been had there been a few more breaks in the shots to bring more story and depth to the characters.\\nStill a solid 8 movie.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Even if you aren't into war films, 1917 is a film one must experience, because there is a simple story, sufficient and efficient, backed by an extraordinary technical accomplishment, which pretty much shapes and enlarges the cinematic experience to the highest degree. The pace just flows flawlessly frame after frame; to me it was intoxicating to have such a personal point of view, it certainly enriched the momentum, it made everything feel more tense, up close yet distant. I was very eager to see what would happen next and how the story would ultimately unfold. We don't get to see the known horrors of war in a crude fashion as it wasn't intended, but we get to witness glimpses of hope and tenderness which add to the emotional impact of the film. And I have to say those moments are necessary because something else is needed besides the constant suspense and continuous turbulent path towards the success of the corporates' mission, otherwise it's hard to feel something for these characters, given that it takes place in a constricted time frame and with a clear objective, that it doesn't leave much room for a film's usual way of progressing.The plot involves a race against time, the context is set, the story is rather simplistic, so the technical aspect is where the strength of the narrative lies. Sam Mendes and his crew were fully aware that they needed a particular way to tell their story so that it would enhance what these young soldiers had to go through by carrying out such a difficult undertaking.1917 is a phenomenal film, with much of its grandness being granted by its technical resources rather than its story itself; so, without its practical prowess would it still be an excellent film? I dare to say that it would not, perhaps it would be a good film, but not an excellent one. The premise isn't lacking in merit, but a film that spans across such a limited time frame can be somewhat difficult to handle regarding certain elements like character development (not that it matters at all in this film), emotional investment and an in-depth plot progress. And on top of all to make it as if it was one long continuous shot is an incredibly hard feat to achieve, but done excellently and cohesively in 1917.Whether you enjoy these type of films or not, whether you heard great things about it or that is overrated, it doesn't matter. Just watch the film and see what everyone else is talking about.\"},\n",

Never in the movie you are bored, you are always at the edge of your seat. The all movie is subliminal, and I can compare it to Dunkirk in the way that character doesn't have a clearly identified personality, this serves the purpose of the director, Mendes wanted us to think that this film was just relating a random day in a low-graded soldier is life. The movie remains surprising. The sound is well-done, you feel that you are a companion of the corporal Schofield, like him you have no clue about was is going to happen, and when he is shot by an enemy solider like him you are tying to find out were the shot came from.I highly recommend this movie, it deserved all his nomination, but more particularly his wins in the technical categories.\"},\n",

While I was watching the movie, i was saying to myself: \"wow this guy just earned an Oscar\". It\\'s amazing how they made the movie look like it\\'s a one shot take. This portrays the duty of soldiers in this cases, meaning that they can\\'t lose a second or their purpose will be affected. As the movie slogan states: \"Time is the enemy\".\\nFor this I outline the amazing director\\'s work and Oscar winning cinematographer Roger Deakins. The script is very good, solid and entertaining. You really get to connect with the characters and fell their emotions, starting from the nap at the beginning to the resting in the tree at the end. It\\'s also emotionally strong since the script takes the WWI atmosphere very crudely showing the horrors of war.\\nFinally sound. Wow. I jumped scared in one of the scenes because of the sound of an explosion I think this is one of the strong points that this movie has. It really immerses you in the environment. When planes pass by the sound of the engine leaves you deaf (not really but).\\nSo, if you have the time and money to waste in this movie just do it, you will have a good time.'},\n",

As the credits rolled, tears certainly did too, and I felt a true affinity with this piece of such artfully crafted cinema, widely stunning, yet intimately removed from being another Hollywood blockbuster.The premise of this epic is relatively simple: two young soldiers are sent on a mission to warn another regiment - where one of their brothers is stationed - of an impending attack. They must reach the regiment by dawn.What follows is not only visually remarkable with the superb cinematography of Roger Deakins, but a compelling journey that the audience is able to follow closely, owing to the film's 'one shot' style. The relatively unknown leads, Dean-Charles Chapman as Blake and George Mackay as Schofield, are similarly superb, embodying the 'everyman' nature of those who served. With the use of star British actors, such as Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Scott, in the roles of higher officers, Mendes also comments on the social divides that were present during WW1. However, the true worth of this film shines particularly through the nuanced development of Schofield, not only through Mackay's determined performance, but through what he is made to endure - an example of storytelling being pushed to attain emotional, physical, and mental heights.1917 is certainly a journey, if anything for its constant movement where no settings are repeated, and it is ultimately marked not by a fantastic display of heroism, but rather the quiet and shockingly harsh endurance of those who fought in the Great War. 1917 could have been the story of any soldier. It is one story amongst millions, and a beautifully forceful one.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'The Stream: The storyline is completely unimportant.The Big Screen: Tremendous filming, scenery and intense moments.The Final Bill: Travel down the intense path less traveled in 1917.Let\\'s get to the nitty gritty of this World War I spectacle.Let\\'s get the plot out of the way, as it is the most forgettable part of the movie. 1917 features two young British privates during the First World War. Of course, the \"powers that be\" give the most expendable pawns with the most to lose the \"impossible mission\". The privates must deliver a message deep in enemy territory that is necessary to save the lives of 1,600 men. And yes, of course, one of the privates has a brother among that 1,600 that must be saved from walking straight into a deadly German trap. Now that the first 5 minutes of the movie are out of the way, we can get to the brilliance.To me one of the most awesome feats of this movie is the single shot filming. Now, we all know it is impossible to shoot a nearly two hour movie in one shot flawlessly, but truly the editing and camerawork is amazing. The single shot view enhances the feel of anxiety and urgency. Throughout the movie, I felt as if I couldn\\'t take my eyes off the screen. One thing I can be certain of is that this movie will definitely receive consideration during award season, especially for the cinematography by Roger Deakins.The filming was great in the execution but also in the setting/scenery. While most of the movie is flat and barren due to the war-torn wasteland, yet the actors take us on the path less traveled. Seriously, through the ups and downs of bunkers, craters, farmlands, waterways, etc. the film moves us. Speaking of moving us, Chapman and MacKay provide a few moving moments, lame ones as well. Both do a very good job conveying the emotional rollercoaster that 1917 and war in general provides to our brave soldiers in the field. The viewer truly follows the ebbs and flows of the privates from beginning to end. We see you King Tommen.Long story short, 1917 is an intense, watch your every step, war epic that will garner Oscar buzz from its incredible camera work and set management. The storyline is the most basic it can get but that\\'s not why you\\'re going to this movie in the first place. Get a bucket of popcorn and chow down while you race (pensively) to the end.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Mendes handles his subject with conviction and deep respect. He provides an inquiry into the resolve of human endurance through an unrelenting portrait of the Great War, delivered with great esteem for soldiering. 1917 is an impressive technical accomplishment. The execution of its concept, the appearance of a 'one-take' continuous shot that propels the viewer through the narrative into a meticulous designed environment. It demonstrates a level of ambition given the genre but feels natural for such a portrayal.The continuous shot provides a subjective experience of The Great War. Often 1917 paints an abstract reflection of the Tommy's state of mind in its atmosphere. Its awareness almost primitive, operating on the fumes of instinct. The imagery conjures up Romanticism in its textual analysis provoking both beauty and horror. Mendes has command over the audience's senses with overwhelming audio-visual shock and awe!Praise will no doubt fall, and rightly so, on the cinematic prowess of Roger Deakins and the design of Dennis Grassner. Grassner provides an authentic quality that complements Deakin's lens. All of which immerses the audience in Mendes's world building. This is a finely tuned collaboration.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Sam Mendes' brilliant war epic, 1917, shows us the horrors which so many young men went through in the darkest days of the First World War. It also hints at the rare melancholic beauty of war, with scenes such as a soldier singing the American folk song (The Wayfairing Stranger) as his brothers in arms sit around him listening with intent. The way Mendes masterfully presents the contrasts of war to us signifies a director on the top of his game.The plot is relatively simple and is loosely based on stories from Sam Mendes' grandfather's own experiences of the First World War. Two soldiers, superbly played by Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, are assigned to deliver a message behind enemy lines. It will stop 1,600 men, including one of the soldier's brothers, from walking straight into a deadly trap. The film puts you in mind of Saving Private Ryan (1998) and the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers (2001), and even Peter Jackson's First World War documentary They Shall Not Grow Old (2018). However none of them delivers the sense of urgency and hopelessness which 1917 exudes.Interestingly, the film is told in real time through a sequence of long takes. Mendes isn't new to the one shot idea, as shown in the opening sequence to 2015's Spectre, but he has never done it for a whole feature length film before. While there are masks and cuts if you look hard enough, this does not subtract from the feeling of urgency at all, in fact it heightens it. There are other films that play with the one shot formal such as Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948) and Victoria (2015) that arguably deal with relationships and characters more effectively. Technically, however, 1917 is something quite unique. What makes it remarkable is the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins, who creates a beautiful ballet with the camera, putting the audience into the shoes of the soldiers. This technique can get a bit distracting at points, nonetheless it generates images and emotions which you wouldn't be able to achieve with multiple shots. For example, there is one shot where one of the characters is running through some ruins while flares go up all around him. In this sequence the lighting and camera work combine to make something truly breathtaking, and is the stuff that dreams (or nightmares) are made of.The film is carried throughout by its two leads. Both Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay are utterly mesmerising, and MacKay in particular gives a performance of a career, and is completely believable in the role. It is a wonder why neither of them were nominated at this year's Oscars. There are also numerous big name actors who appear in minor roles throughout the film, such as Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Mark Strong, but they just act as seasoning which punctuates the overall narrative. That is not to disregard their contribution; Andrew Scott gives a perfectly dry and callous performance as a cynical Lieutenant, while Colin Firth gives a solid matter of fact performance as General Erinmore. It is all credit to the filmmakers' ingenuity for not making these cameos feel out of place or unduly dominate their respective scenes.The tale of love, loyalty and friendship that Mendes presents to us is something which everyone should bear witness to. It acts as a reminder of what those brave young men sacrificed. 1917 is worthy of all the praise given to it.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917: A different kind of war movie: Up close and personal. Opening shot: a bucolic field of wild flowers, a lovely, calm day, blue cloudless sky, quite, serine, slowly pulls back to reveal a bivouac of British troops, sleeping, smoking, eating, refreshing, resting, waiting. It's WWI. The phone lines have been cut and two British soldiers are called to the Commanding General's bunker and are given the mission to deliver a message to the commander of another regiment a few miles away, that they must call off a planned attack scheduled for dawn the following morning because the German army has set a trap that will ensure the massacre of 1600 men, one of whom is the brother of one of the soldiers. We go along with them through enemy territory, through the mud and over the bodies of the dead, determined to complete their harrowing mission. The entire film looks like it was shot in real time in one continuous take with a hand-held steady cam. The cuts are nearly imperceptible. Birdman employed this technique wonderfully, but this endeavor far surpasses that in artistry, complexity, scope and length. This is a technical achievement without comparison. But technical achievement means nothing if there is no compelling story and investment in the characters and 1917 delivers. We are drawn in to the action so closely that we almost duck when bullets start flying. We care deeply about these two young men. It's edge-of-your-seat tension. The score by Thomas Newman enhances every moment and is profoundly moving. We're aware of it, but it doesn't call attention to itself as our pulses race along with the action. The production design is brilliant. Roger Deakins is probably the greatest cinematographer of all time. He was also the A camera operator and I can only imagine how he and director Sam Mendes managed to pull this off. I read they were in rehearsal for six months planning every shot. Score: 10. GO! Well deserving of every Oscar nomination it's gotten. 1/22/20\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Mendes\\' directorial style shines in this fairly \"paint by the Spielberg numbers\" lean yet big film. It\\'s quite literally a one at right line approach in filmmaking and storyline.The score, pacing, and the nearly impeccable camera work drive this nearly non stop sequential film about a young pair of soldiers sent into enemy fronts to deliver a message to abort a major military move that the Germans have actually planned on.If you like the pacing of Dunkirk, enjoy the cinematic camera lens of Malicks Thin Red Line and the simplistic premise of Spielbergs take, Saving Private Ryan, you\\'ll find a lot here on all fronts.War is violent, so theres the expected war time violence but nothing too exploitive.Best Picture? I lean towards Parasite, as the premise of the script is fairly predictable as it is...not even sure spoilers are a thing in this film---but direction has to considered for Mendes for the scale alone and the \"in the bunker\" camera work. Sound and editing are spot  on, which makes for a very enjoyable war film.8/10'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'My take on 1917 :It is a war movie but like no other, I mean in terms of the film\\'s take on World War I (WW I). It doesn\\'t show you the usual chaotic war sequence all the way, rather it takes you for a journey which will suck you in and soaks you thoroughly in the mood during those times.Mendes known for his big films Spectre, Skyfall doesn\\'t fail to impress the audience in presenting a visually astounding story of two courageous soldiers embarking on a journey to deliver a message that could save 1600 fellow soldiers.What worked for me was the amalgamation of brilliant direction, screenplay, cinematography, lighting, the whole productions design, top notch sound mixing, background score and class performance by the two leads. It all kind of fell in perfect blend which set the tone of grimness on the viewers.The level of detailing in the movie was so immersive that we are teleported to the war trenches. There were scenes in the dark where the soldier is running for a hide out and the flashes of grenades illuminates him, watching this on big screen was sheer breath taking. The song \"Poor wayfaring stranger\" when sung by one of the soldier before their big day was moving.At the end, we come out of the move as proud as the soldier saving the battalion from the trap.Overall Mendes\\'s 1917 is a pure cinematic brilliance and will be a strong contender for the Best Picture of 2019.PS: Watch it in biggest screen possible.-Review by Sivakumar Balachandran.'},\n",

The first person technique that the director choose is genius and allows you to fully empathize with the characters, but the rhythm is so quick and with enough twists so that you can never rest or even take a breath. After this movie I was physically tired and could wait for the character to break down. It really makes you understand how allienating the war was and what 60 millions of men had to suffer.

Many are also praising the cinematogrophy however I don't actually like the 'one take' style since it creates such weird inconsistencies in time.In normal moviemaking when you transition between shots, there is the opportunity to let some time pass between the shots and the viewer is aware of this. But when I watch this 'one take' style and time passes on the other side of a wall for example, I just got confused and really thought it would be better of just throwing in cuts in some places. You could still use long immersive takes without making the whole movie 'one take' for a meme or something.Regarding story and characters, this movie is just not good. The story is very simple and quite frankly, ridiculous. The characters appear very briefly and is never seen again except for the protagonists which struggle during the whole movie with walking, occationally running and lots of panting.If there would have been an interesting story with perhaps more character developments, this could have been a great movie.

Thomas Newman's soundtrack is brilliant and suiting, photography is decent but color grading is lacklustre and monotonous (compared to Dunkirk). When you talk about experience films you've got to get soundtrack and cinematography matching the tension you want to create. It worked perfectly with Hans Zimmer and Hoyte van Hoytema in Dunkirk but 1917 lacks it for some reason which cuts off the tension a couple of times and then you've to rebuild again. It might've to do with the story too, very flat which allows your mind to wander off whereas Nolan tried to create a puzzle out of the three pieces in Dunkirk.There's a few very good jump scares that can break a weak heart.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"So the pretext is that in the context of Operation Alberich, where the Germans fell back from two salients that they seized to the Hindenburg Line, a British general who has for some reason decided to put his headquarters at the front lines at the end of one of these salients, decides to call off one little isolated attack. But because the general is in a bad position to communicate with troops under his command and because the Germans have magically destroyed all the telephone lines, the general decides\\n1. Wait for an hour or so for the telephone lines to be repaired and then calls off the attack\\n2. Sends a runner back to headquarters to which sends a message by telephone to a place where they can send a runner to call off the attack.\\n3. Sends their driver (they are a general, they would have a driver) to deliver the message via the roads around the area.\\n4. Relocates their headquarters to a central location where they can communicate more easily with troops under his command.\\n5. Use a set of runners to run behind the lines in shifts to get the message to call off the attack to the troops.\\n6. Sends 2 soldiers to cross deadman's land and the former German lines, then cross British lines without being shot (ummm...they actually skip that bit in the movie) and deliver the order.If you chose 6, then you are an idiot and will enjoy this movie and have a good shot at being a Hollywood hot shot. Otherwise, just enjoy the acting and cinematography of this movie where very little makes sense.\"},\n",

Here's some questions for you: Would you stand in an open field watching an enemy plane get shot down above you and not move an inch until it almost crashes in to you? Would you try to save the enemy from the burning plane after your own guys put effort in to shooting him down? Would you discover a pail of milk and fill your canteen with it instead of the nearby water outlet? Would the obviously resourceful enemy leave the milk just sitting there? Would the enemy leave the dairy cow alive, knowing their enemy would soon be there, low on supplies? Then, would you give your milk away to a woman with a baby? (gee, how convenient.) Would a truck driver in an open field drive through the only mud puddle for no reason only to get stuck? I'll stop here. The movie was ok, way to simple of a plot, and way too many holes. I didn't appreciate the unnecessary editing magic that eliminated any/all cuts. Hope this helps.\"},\n",

I didn't think any film would come close to Joker this year, but 1917 has arrived right next to the DC masterpiece. Huge amount of credits go to cinematography. It's an incredible talent because once the movie starts, you would realize that the director has not shouted CUT! and the cameras are rolling and the movie is moving ahead without any cuts! The actors' expressions, their makeup, the whole war scenario art composition, the story with a fabulous direction serves us a day in life of soldiers making us awe, worry, laugh, cry, and appreciate such a creation.My rating 9.2 🌟\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Filming a movie in one continuous take sounds good in theory, but as 1917 shows, doesn't work in practice. It shows that this style should be used sparingly, and in just some scenes, like the amazing waterfall scene, which looks fantastic.Overall the one take makes for a very slow journey which at times is just boring.Another problem is that once again we have the curse of written and directed by the same person. Noooo!\\nThis means there is no one to tell the writer where they have gone wrong. And it also looked like there were no military advisors either.At times the visuals were amazing, but there were numerous script errors.Why would two soldiers who have been bombed and machine gunned race to pull a German pilot from his crashed plane? Why would the pilot (who has been badly burnt) stab his rescuer?How could a soldier with hob nail boots walk across a metal hand rail on a bridge - he would have slipped off.When fighting a sniper, if you keep popping up from the same spot you would be quickly shot - unlike the hero.When you are being shot at you hear the impact of the bullet (it doesn't explode like in this move) and at the same time the crack of the bullet, and then the sound of the gun being fired - depending on how far away the shooter is. Unlike depicted here.Please stop showing soldiers before the 80's walking around like SWAT with their rifles at the shoulder - they didn't do this! They normally carried their rifles at the port.And why didn't our hero swing and hit the German soldier with the butt of his rifle instead of grabbing him and telling him to be quiet? The butt swing was part of basic bayonet fighting drill back then.Why wasn't there continuous gunfire in the background? Especially at the end when at the aid station where there was total silence.Why were the men sprinting once over the top? They weren't running a 50 metre race, but having to walk maybe 100 metres through mud and shell holes and fight at the other end. historical footage shows the troops walking.And to finish, there was too much energy at the aid station at the end. These would have been exhausted troops. Just carrying a body on a stretcher for 50 metres is hard work enough. Yet extras are running everywhere.1917 should have been so much better. Such a shame.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"There have been some incredible war films in the past, 'Saving Private Ryan', 'All Quiet On The Western Front' and of course 'Schindler's List' but the 2019 release, both written and directed by Sam Mendes, '1917' is easily one of the best.\\nGeorge Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman star as two soldiers in the middle of World War 1, who are sent across enemy lines, and deep into enemy territory, to deliver an urgent message that will result in the saving of 1600 lives.\\nMy first mention has to go to cinematographer Roger Deakins. This is an outstandingly beautifully shot movie. It has been filmed to look like one continuous shot, following these two soldiers through a war.\\nObviously, there are moments in the film where I'm sure cuts were made, darkness obscures the screen for a moment, but despite that, this is a massive technical achievement and the brilliance of it can not be ignored. As they progress from the open graveyard of no man's land to the abandoned but still dangerous German trenches, the unexpected fallout from a dogfight to a burning town in the dead of night, most audiences will quickly stop thinking about the technique at play and simply give themselves over, entirely, to this journey into hell.\\nThe production, costume and pace of the film are simply perfect. It takes you along on their mission as if you are with them and there are some seriously edgy moments too.\\nThe thing I loved about the film, well one of the things I loved about the film, is the feeling of 'realism'. It isn't a sweet, sentimental, predictable jaunt, it's full of problems for these guys. They come across trip-wires underground, deserted villages where you're not sure if they are actually deserted. It's seriously nerve-wracking, you never feel like they're safe, this is done so well in this film, they always feel like there's someone just around the corner.\\nOne sequence, in particular, is so intense. One of the characters is running through this rubble and flares are going off, and gunfire can be heard in the background and you think at any second, one of these bullets could hit this guy, and the music is rising, along with the tension, it is 'edge of your seat' stuff.\\nThe acting is, well simply outstanding. Director Sam Mendes wanted to make sure the lead characters were not 'big names' and relatively unknowns and this was an excellent choice as it made you care more about the actual characters.\\nThere are a few 'names' as cameos, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Andrew Scott make appearances but it's the leads that you invest in.The direction from Mendes is exceptional. The score from Thomas Newman, who has scored films for Sam Mendes before, including 'Road To Perdition', 'Skyfall' and 'American Beauty' to name a few, is so good in this film.\\nThe visual effects are incredible.\\nIf I had any 'niggles' it would be that the character development of the leads was a touch weak, and as much as you are invested in what's happening you don't care as much as you could.\\nThis is a remarkable film though, and with all, it's technical brilliance, it's amazing acting, atmosphere, tension and incredible visuals the 'niggle' I had is insignificant.\\nEasily one of the best films I have seen in a very long time.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Set throughout the course of 24 hours during April 1917, two young soldiers in World War I (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) are given a mission by their general to travel from their bunker to one deep into enemy territory to warn a regiment of the British army to call off their attack at the break of dawn. There's strong intel that is a trap and in order to save the lives of 1600 men, one of which is one of the protagonists brothers, they need to reach the bunker in time. Sam Mendes is one of today's greatest directors; absolute classics like American Beauty and Road To Perdition and two great Bond films under his belt, make anything his name is attached to worth a watch. It's beautifully dedicated to Lance Corporal Arthur Mendes as mentioned in the credits which give it a moving personal touch. Visually it is incredible and works on the basis of feeling like one continuous shot. I've always loved this idea since I was young and adored films that incorporate this even just for certain scenes such as Alfonso Cuaron's Children Of Men or that great episode of Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's Psychoville. So this really pleased me from a cinephile perspective! On a technical level, it is a massively impressive achievement and its first hour in particular is non stop intensity, it's truly captivating. I'm sad to admit though that there are a couple of scenes in the last half that I did feel meandered and took me out of the experience a fair bit. There are moments in there designed as a breather from the drama which I felt would be okay if I was more engaged on an emotional level. The performances are absolutely spectacular still, it's just that it's a film written more with the visual scope and atmosphere in mind than necessarily character. Nevertheless, definately worth a watch on the biggest screen you can find!\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I just finished watching this and while it\\'s not the worst war movie ever made it\\'s not the best either.\\nThe novel thing about this movie is the non-stop linear action. It\\'s a style that\\'s rarely been done before and in this movie they make it work. Most of the movie is suspense, muck, mud, mire and fear and this movie does a good job of portraying the squalor of WW1 trench life.For all that though there\\'s surprisingly little action. The long lulls in between action do get almost dull and when the action happens the payoff isn\\'t enough for putting up with the rest of it.The movie rates high for telling a story seldom told in the 21st century, that of the first world war - a war almost forgotten and practically eclipsed by the second. Other than that though, I can think of the far superior remake of \"All quiet on the western front\" starring Richard Thomas from 1979 that tells the story much better than this, really minimalist war film.'},\n",

The acting (especially the two leads Dean Charles Chapman and George McKay) is great from all concerned too.I have a few gripes, the two main soldiers are pretty naive when it comes to the enemy, they are either trying to help injured Germans, or don't kill them when the have the chance!! Only for the Germans to try and kill them first chance they get.I'm surprised this won best picture at the Golden Globes, as for me it is not better than Joker, The Irishman or Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen, it deserves it.\"},\n",

But seriously, not to take away from Parasite's deserved success, and politics aside, 1917 in my opinion was the best movie of the group, this coming from someone who is a) not into war movies and b) feels that war movies automatically gets a nomination even if there were more deserving movies instead (I'm talking to you, Hacksaw Ridge and American Sniper.) It is just unfortunate that 1917 and Parasite were released in the same year, otherwise they would've easily won the award if they were nominated in different editions of the Oscars.1917 is based on director Sir Sam Mendes's grandfather's experience as a messenger during World War I and because of this you can feel his investment in the storytelling. There's a 11 minute featurette available online where you can see the massive undertaking that went into making the movie. In it they talk about the 6-month rehearsal needed in order to get everything perfectly timed because they wanted to give the impression that everything was done in just one take. The concept of doing the movie in one shot and real-time allows for an immersive experience, letting you to go through the story along with the protagonists. The choreography of the shots were impressive as not one second is wasted because there are details to keep you glued in while waiting to see the actors again. Cinematography was impressive as well for a movie that kept going forward and no location was repeated. Cinematographer Sir Roger Deakins has won 20 awards for this movie alone, including the Oscars.You will root for George MacKay, you will get annoyed at Dean-Charles Chapman's naivete (as we also did when he was in Game of Thrones.) Cameos from Colin Firth, Andrew Scott (you just knew he was going to play that kind of officer) Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch (again, you just knew he was going to play that kind of officer) did not distract as they all seamlessly made their way in the movie.\"},\n",

It was intense and engaging the whole time, with moments of fast paced action sprinkled throughout which really got the heart racing.Despite knowing very little about the two main characters, their realistic acting makes you care and worry for them. The one shot technique keeps you beside them and makes you feel like you're there with them.However my only gripe with the film is that it does slow down a bit too much once or twice. Thankfully this barely took away from the experience.Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of saving private Ryan or hacksaw ridge (for me at least), it is a groundbreaking achievement in cinema and an amazing ride! Definitely go watch it.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'After the curious German retreat to the Hindenburg Line during Operation Alberich, two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) are sent several miles into enemy territory to call off a doomed offensive.Released in 2019, \"1917\" was inspired by stories told to director Sam Mendes by his paternal grandfather about his combat experiences. The film is known for the impressive effect of two continuous takes, which was accomplished thru long takes and cinematic wizardry.The plot has similarities to \"Saving Private Ryan,\" albeit taking place in a period 27 years earlier. Of course with World War 1 you automatically think of films like \"Paths of Glory,\" \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1979) and \"War Horse.\" This is as good or better. It\\'s like a tour through the trenches and surrounding areas with all the shocking challenges thereof, like rotting corpses, rats, booby traps, aerial combat, sudden death and crumbling villages, mixed with brief moments of goodwill, irony, awe and even beauty.The film runs 1 hour, 59 minutes, and was shot in England & Scotland.GRADE: A-'},\n",

If you want to see this, make an effort to see it in a theater. The number one thing that the theater enhances about the movie is the cinematography. This is the movie that deserves to win Best Cinematography at The Academy Awards. At one point of the movie, there is a straight 30 minutes or so that is the best cinematography of the last 2 years by a landslide. You learn about the characters and their dynamics with eachother through their dialogue and how they react to the situations they are put in. The score was used so effectively and made the scenes so much more intense. Also, it (the score) was very good. I wanted to stay for the credits because I wanted to listen to it. I can\\'t decide if this movie, Marriage Story, or Joker should win Best Score at The Oscars, but I\\'d be happy with any of these. The sound mixing was another extremely effective aspect of this movie, and to quote my dad, \"The gun shots are the most realistic I\\'ve ever heard.\" This movie should absolutely win the Oscar for it\\'s sound editing. I also really hope that the movie wins the Oscar for Achievements in Makeup and Hairstyling. All of the dirt, blood, and water in this movie looked so realistic and amazing, but Bombshell will most likely win the award. This movie, Parasite, and Knives Out are all tied for me as to what I think should win Best Screenplay. And finally, regarding Best Picture, as long as this or Marriage Story wins, I will be happy. And to top all of these things off, the movie takes place on my birthday.'},\n",

Two hours of following the two soldiers, then one, try to get the extremely important message to save 1,600 lives.It is intended to look like one uninterrupted take, but is actually a bunch of longs takes (longest was 9 minutes) stitched together perfectly at points where detail was not critical, like following William running from the other side of a fragmented wall, in the dark.The good:Outstanding set. Pristine, spotless mostly, even beautiful, but not realistic.Cinematography. From a technical point of view, outstanding. I can't imagine better, given the one-shot requirement by the writer/directory. But, boring after the first long fast walks through trenches.Special effects. Excellent, I think, which means not obvious -- most of the time.The bad:1. There is NO story. Let's just say one, get the message to the commander about being ambushed. 2. Way too many narrow escapes. All those open shots at William and not one hit him. Most of them not even close. 3. Everything dead except a cow. Plus a bucket of milk fresh enough to drink and no one around to milk the cow. 4. Planes flying over that could have easily dropped a message to the commander in a short length of time, but no, let's do it the nearly impossible way. 5. A beautiful woman with someone else's unexpectedly in the basement room where William ducks into while being chased. And, guess what, he has a canteen full of milk. The baby coos and makes happy noises though starving. There goes the one long take. 6. William walks up on a huge group of soldiers with one standing in the center singing and no one notices or questions him, even after several minutes. 7. Plenty of time and skill to tiptoe across the broken side of a bridge and jump 5 or 6 feet from one narrow (6 - 7 inches) beam to another. I wonder how many times that took. One screw up and they have to start over at the beginning -- one shot. 8. Clean cloths, clean, shaven faces, nice perfectly white teeth. 9. Zero character development.I could go on and on.I couldn't wait for it to be over, but always expecting it had to get better because of all the reviews. Two stars for cinematography and set design.\"},\n",

The focus was solely on the two soldiers and those they came into contact with along the way. Friend and foe alike. This gave a very real 'third person' feel to the experiences these men would have felt undertaking such an immensely important task.The scenes were captivating in the sense that the natural environments untouched by war were remarkably beautiful. Yet, their journey takes them through war-torn stretches of countryside which is anything but.On top of the experience of following the soldiers on their journey is the musical score. This set the mood for the peace and tranquility of the beautiful countryside, undertaking the burdens of responsibility and traversing the war-torn landscape littered by death and destruction.Not to mention that the characters were truly memorable.

In addition, the story can only progress through the characters and situations they come across, hence the effect, however touching, is that of chapters in a video game.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This is an exceptional movie and work of art. While some may be critical of the true grusomeness and horror that was the first World War, I feel this movie captured aspects of it without glorifying it. You don\\'t have scenes of soldiers in a trench being blown to pieces from an enemy shell, but you do hear soldiers speaking about it in a nonchalant way, along with the \"gallows humour\" that developed over the war in the trenches. There is horror all around you, and this movie does well not throwing it in your face but doesn\\'t allow you to ever escape it.The other criticisms I can see comes from a character development standpoint. You are left not knowing much of the backstory to the main characters or why they behave the way they do. But in the first World War, where you could have 30,000 die in a single day for the British, human life did not have the value we assume it should. It\\'s because of this that I think it is fitting to not delve into backstory and character development, since the recurring theme of the movie shows the constant waste of life and futility in these battles. However, I feel you get tremendous character development just by observing their behaviour, a tremendous accomplishment by the cast, where the viewer can predit their past by the way they behave in the present.I hope the success of this movie brings along with it more attention to the first World War. It has set the bar high, and has done a great service to future generations seeking to learn more about the history of World War 1.'},\n",

WWI was chaos without doubt but the military was not commanded by complete idiots as the plot line would have us believe. There is no possible such an incredibly import job would be handled in the way portrayed. The movie was full of cliches and the usual war movie tropes. 1917 has been promoted as a \"one take\" movie but ........it isn\\'t. Dont get me wrong, the camera work is outstanding but the rest ...... not so much. The settings just failed to achieve realism in most cases .... trenches too clean for one thing.

I got emotional a few times.I do caution that as a War movie, it's more of a drama than an action film. Sure there's action and suspense, and some thrills, but this isn't Saving Private Ryan or Dunkirk from a visceral standpoint. It's smaller in both scale and scope.1917 follows a couple of soldiers as they journey to the front line carrying information which could save over a thousand of their fellows soldiers' lives... if they get there in time.It's in the aforementioned scale and scope where 1917 falls short of being great. The main plot of the movie suffered for not being big enough or feeling important enough. There's no storming of the beaches at Normandy. No rousing Winston Churchill speech at the end. The film doesn't connect the events it depicts into their greater significance in the war. Again, it felt small scale and narrow in scope.But to reiterate, I very much liked it. It's a lovely film filled with tension and emotion, think Kubrick's Paths of Glory without the 10/10 ending. Great work by all involved: Director Sam Mendes, Composer Thomas Newman, the whole cast and crew.One of the years best films, probably at the bottom of my top ten.\"},\n",

The acting is superb. The effects are, well, effective. The sets are authentic. The score is appropriately haunting. The situation engages the viewer and keeps them on the edge of their seat through the whole show.Still... if felt like something was missing that really should be there.It took a few viewings to pick up on the fact that there is virtually NO reference to religion or a higher-power except for maybe the occasional blasphemous swear. Most people may not see this as an issue but as the saying goes, \"There are no atheists in foxholes.\"Having served in the army infantry myself, I\\'ve seen how difficult and potentially life-threatening situations cause men to seek (and find) a higher power to provide comfort, reason, courage, motivation and assurance when suddenly they are faced with the fact that they might die or at least be severely wounded... much the same way many criminals \"find God\" when put behind bars, but in the case of war, much more rapidly and acutely.There were no chaplains to be found. There were no occasional shots of single or groups of men knelt in prayer or praying over their fallen friends. Even before the climactic attack on the Germans, the British group of soldiers about to attack sits solemnly in a wood line listening to a single soldier sing a traditional sad song but one that has no mention of God or religion... only a vague \"I\\'m going home\" refrain which alludes to an afterlife but it may as well be Valhalla. There was no chaplain or even another regular soldier leading the group in prayer which would have certainly been the norm for this particular group of soldiers facing what might well be their doom. Not even as wounded and dying soldiers are stacked up back in the rear is there any chaplain giving last rights.I just found the complete absence of religion in such desperate situations to be inappropriate, unrealistic and suspicious especially back in a time where religion was much more a part of people\\'s lives than it is today. \"There are no atheists in foxholes\" but you wouldn\\'t know it from this film.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917 is stunning in both its visual impact as well as its acting. I have long been a fan of war movies that are done well and this film is the epitome of powerful storytelling of war. Sam Mendes' decision to use a single shot format carries the audience through the trenches with the soldiers. Their fear is palpable and translates from the screen to the theatre. And Thomas Newman's lyrical score provides a superb background to the story-never intrusive but enhances the action. I cannot capture the excellence of the two chief actors who set a high bar for the big names that support them in the story. 1917 is certain to be a classic-I know it will be one of my all-time favorite movie experiences.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The Battle of the Somme is long gone in the stark April sunshine of 1917, as Sam Mendes directs a desperate dash through No Man's Land, with the historic still images of the Western Front vividly brought to life. Colin Firth's General Erinmore has an urgent message to send to the Devonshire regiment further up the front line. Do Not Attack, he has seen aerial footage that shows they are walking into a trap. But the German have cut the telegraph wires, and the only way to get through to Écoust-Saint-Mein is on foot.The orders are given to the boyish Dean-Charles Chapman's Lance Corporal Blake, and he picks George MacKay's Lance Corporal Schofield to accompany him. The Germans have retreated out of their trenches, and the path will be clear, but the two young soldiers are given hand grenades in their pack. Just in case! In The Lord of the Rings, Frodo and Sam's chances of reaching Mordor were slim. 1600 men's lives depend on Blake and Schofield's game of life to get the message through. But like our Hobbits, their chances are equally slim, and to add urgency to the journey, one of the soldiers due to go over the top is Blake's older brother. They have until dawn to stop the attack. And will have to cross No Man's Land in daylight.As they force their way through the trench to the front line, the camera follows at their shoulders, Andrew Scott's Lieutenant thinks the journey it's madness. Fighting for every inch of the land and then to suddenly have the Germans pull back. But he 'blesses' the two soldiers with his whiskey, riffing on the 'Hot Priest', and tells them to send a flare up if they make it. Otherwise they'll try and pull them back when night falls!Cutting the way through the hostile barbed wire, cinematographer Roger Deakins sweeps the camera across the stinking mud. But the landscape is silent as Blake and Schofield creep their way across. While the words of the WWI poets ring distantly in our ears. What tolling bells for those who die as cattle. Wilfred Owen's lament, past the bloated soldiers submerged in mud, past the horses unable to outrun the guns, past the ghosts of once trees. As clouds of flies fill the air and scurrying rats feast on the dead.The action plays as a single shot of the day, immersing the viewers in the real time carnage of the story. The pock marked battlefield is the star, with Production Design by Dennis Gassner, as Blake and Schofield face the eerie horrors, and eventually tumble into the German trenches. These were well made for the men to dig in, but now empty save for a lovers photograph. But the Germans have not made their retreat easy, with leaps of faith in the pitch black booby trapped potential tomb. And a later aerial dogfight brings the fight to the ground, with an act of mercy that leads to catastrophic results. Sam Mendes isn't afraid to show the PTSD among the men, with George Mackay particularly good at looking shellshocked. I've followed his career since Sunshine On Leith, in that joyous musical he was happy! But here his face is perfect for misery.But the message must get through, with the camaraderie along the way of those brave young men and boys going off to fight who knows where. Mark Strong almost unrecognisable, but full of support and help as his men are also headed towards the Devonshires, but must divert when a blown up bridge bars their vehicles route. A sniper taking shots halts the rhythm of the film, throwing us into darkness, until we stagger round for the final push. Écoust-Saint-Mein is within reach just downstream, but in a nightmare town Germans are blowing up the remains in their retreat. The camera following any way they can as we run to the river, bullets whizzing past while red flares half light the ruined town. And with dawn breaking the tension is relentless. In exhausted relief we hear the sound of silence and a lone singer. Jos Slovick and his soulful Wayfaring Stranger.But it really is a final sprint to deliver the message, with Deakins incredible filming again and shells exploding over men just to our left, and the force knocking us down in those last moments of urgency to stop the whistles blowing.Among the terrific ensemble cast were cameos including Daniel Mays, Richard Madden and Benedict Cumberbatch. No one stealing the limelight though, just getting on with the job in those precious hours, and hoping to live another day. Watching the film felt like a lifetime in the blink of an eye. All those lives that didn't grow old, and those that grew old far too early, but came home. Very poignant with a tight crew that deserve all the awards coming their way.\"},\n",

Private Ryan didn't get best movie Oscar, but was 100% better than this movie for lots of reasons, Tom Hanks being the main one. Dunkirk didn't get Oscar for best movie despite being 50% better than this movie. This movie didn't need to try and outdo Dunkirk on the musical tension, in fact, the village fantasyland suite was misplaced. Definitely an Oscar for screenplay, and best British cameos (lol). I recommend to see this movie, but after all the hype, and bearing in mind some of the truly outstanding war movies of the past 20 years, it didn't move me as much as others. And it didn't need to. It's a superbly executed narrative, and the final 10 minutes is worth the buildup. But be careful of the hype.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I like realism in my films and 1917 didn't disappoint. I was initially concerned by the trench shown in the promo film, but watching the whole film reveals its context.The film kept my attention from start to finish, jumping in my seat in the underground bunker scenes. Nothing was predictable, and the film moved at a good pace.The scene at the end where the troops prepare to go over the top was quite tense, the use of a whistle to signify the start of an attack sends shivers down the spine when you are aware of what it signifies.There will be detractors stating its not as good as Saving Private Ryan, that is also a good film. There are people stating there are historical inaccuracies in 1917, well look up if there were any Tiger tanks in the American sector in Saving Private Ryan used in the final scene and you will find there wasn't, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good film.The reason few German soldiers are depicted in 1917 is because they had retreated to the Hindenburg line, if you look up any interviews with Mendes he will tell you he choose this particular time frame as the front line was more fluid and it enabled him to produce a film that wasn't constricted by a few hundred yards of no mans land. The Germans had withdrawn, left their trenches and were taking up positions in a well defended line, which incidentally is explained by the officer in the opening few minutes. Therefore it being April, and beyond the no mans land killing zones the landscape would be lush and green.I saw a post on a review elsewhere where somebody was complaining the Indian soldiers turban had been tied in a modern fashion. Like i said I like realism in a film but there is nothing in 1917 that would make me sit back in disgust.All in all a great film, would recommend.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This film is Sam Mendes' magnum opus. You would think the whole 'single take' hook would come off as a gimmick, but it is incredibly effective at making you really feel like you're in the trenches with our protagonists. This was most certainly a film you had to see on the big screen - the magic is partially lost on any other device.That being said, that doesn't take away from the overall experience. Unlike more harrowing war films, like Come and See or the 2022 All Quiet on the Western Front that are probably a more brutally realistic depiction of war, 1917 takes a slightly 'cleaner', more fantastical approach, but by no means is the setting of the First World War depicted as anything less than a depressing, miserable nightmare. By the finale, we are as exhausted as our protagonist, Schofield is, and it ends on a bittersweet note. Thousands of lives were saved, but only for millions more to fall later. And who knows, maybe even Schofield didn't make it to the end.Soundtrack and cinematography were also amazing. I can't commend Thomas Newman's score enough. And the continuous take method really does make this film stand out among the rest. In retrospect, his previous film really was just a testing ground for the long take. Spectre walked so 1917 could run .The visuals and music as Schofield and Blake cross into the misty and surreal open field of no man's land was a highlight of the entire movie, and it happens at the very beginning!Even people who don't like war films should watch this. Truly one of the greatest films I've ever seen.\"},\n",

Cinematography, yes, but story and plot absolutely not.This is a big fail of a movie if they are taking it seriously and pawning it off as award worthy. It just does not suffice.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"A movie that excels in all areas.Technically- visually amazing. The one shot camera works really well for 98% of the film (only missing on some fairly important reaction shots), it especially helps during scenes of tension. Lighting is done really well considering the work arounds they had to go though, and there's one scene where they use creative lighting to create the most spectacular images. Sound is amazing too, my first watch through I barely noticed it as it blended so well with the scenes - it definitely helps set a tone (especially in the Van).Story and characters - brilliantly done. So many movies miss this mark (in my opinion) but the characters we are presented with are so lovable and real and it's hard not to get attached to the two main boys. The others all do their roles amazingly well with either setting up a sense of danger, being a helpful - sympathetic, and so on (won't say for spoilers).\\nThe story is so well told, brilliantly paced and just so well done. A simple story about a single day and it's told to perfection. Things from the start come back later (which is always fun and rewarding to the viewer). It also shows the daily horrors of war in a casual way and it is most haunting.I adore this film and recommend it to everyone and anyone.\"},\n",

If the directing, cinematography, and one shot wouldn't have been there, I don't think this movie would even be talked about this year.The story is on the lighter side because it's about delivering a message. We've seen this before. The film comes alive with these master filmmakers doing what they do best!The only thing weird about this movie is when the soldier stumbled upon the mom and her baby. That entire scene seemed a little weird to me. It didn't seem to fit the movie for me.The Oscar slate is stacked this year but if you see any movie in theaters this Oscar season, this is the one to see.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'On the same day that the United States declares war on Germany, two young British lance corporals are faced with an apparently impossible mission: to cross the french battlefield carrying an order to cancel an attack and prevent the massacre of at least 1600 british soldiers.Set in the penultimate year of the First World War, 1917 is one of those films that arrest the viewer in the first minutes and then drag him up and down without giving him time to breathe.Merit of director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, 007: Skyfall), who also signs the script, based on stories told by his grandfather, a former Great War fighter.Recorded as a great sequence shot, with really imperceptible cuts, 1917 throws the audience into the drama of soldiers Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman, from Game of Thrones) and Schofield (George MacKay, from Captain Fantastic) on their journey through a France in pieces, which will test their beliefs, courage and friendship to the last strength.The cinematography of the veteran Roger Deakins, an Oscar winner in 2018 for Blade Runner 2049, is a complete show apart, always leading the narrative to the best of the script, at the right time - there are no mistakes here.With 1917, Mendes managed to make not only one of the greatest (and best) war films of all time, but also present the audience with a great cinema class and a true dramatic experience. An instant classic.Let the Oscars come.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This film is easily the most immersive movie I have seen all year. From the time the title card was displayed until the time the credits rolled, I was totally enthralled by the events of the film. 1917 had me on the edge of my seat for 2 hours straight and left me feeling as if I had just endured the events firsthand.\\nStorytelling - 1917 was basically 2 hours of great decision-making. The film drops the viewer off at the best possible moment so that we truly feel as if we are in the situation. This is a feeling that, although established immediately, lingers for the entirety of the film's runtime. Every emotion that the characters felt throughout the movie-dress, fear, despair, triumph, anger- I felt right alongside them. The film strays far from the formula typical to most movies, causing a pervasive sensation unpredictability and fear. Overall, while the story was limited in its scope by the fact that it was almost actual-time, it soars through its unique style and extreme realism. 9/10\\nActing - The acting in this film is truly masterful. The two leads did a fantastic job of portraying their characters in manner that helped the audience sympathize with them almost immediately. Certain sequences required the actors convey a wide variety of emotion using nothing but their facial expressions. Once again, the film moves at such a pace that it is very hard for the actors to slow down and really explore deeper emotions, but the still played their parts expertly. 9/10\\nScript - 1917 has considerably less dialogue than many films that came out this year. This kept it from being as deep as other films, and yet, like all the other categories, it worked fantastically for the film. There were definitely hints of depth and history between certain characters found in the lines, and I cannot complain on any level. 9/10\\nCharacters - This is where the film was impacted most by the frenetic pace. It was very rare that the two leads were not in an extremely tense, life-threatening situation which made it very hard to delve into their characters and understand more about them. It's hard to truly complain about the characters, but they certainly were not as well-explored as some other films. It worked great for the film, but I still feel as if I should maintain a single standard for all films. 8/10\\nCinematography - I'll keep this brief. The best cinematography of the year. Hands down. Constant, superb decision-making from Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins made this film stand out among the dozens of war films that have been released and created one of the best film experiences I have ever had. 10/10\\nPersonal opinion - As always, I factor in the way that I personally felt about the film. I left this movie feeling as if I had seen a huge step for film in general. The way this film was crafted truly make it a work of art. I typically prefer strong er characters, but 1917 did everything he could do to strengthen the characters and, with minimal work from the audience, the characters develop quite nicely all things considered. I adored this film and cannot wait to experience it again. I personally give this film a 9/10. Overall, the score evens out to be 9.0/10.\"},\n",

The decision to phrase this film as one take created a ticking time bomb feel a cultivated a real closeness with the characters. It truly felt like we were on this journey with Blake and Schofield, experiencing the horror and tension alongside them.The way that the film flips from eerie quiet to panic and chaos was masterful. I was never quite sure what would be coming next, echoing the unknown adventure that both men embarked on.Mendes' crowning glory in his career has to be the final 20 minutes of this film. Him and Deakins produced a truly stunning shot as Schofield ran across the line, perhaps one of the most visual stunning and emotional shots I've seen. I was so moved by the final 20 minutes of the film as the futility of war was presented so expertly.1917, while perhaps a little thin on plot and script is an incredibly moving and powerfil portrayal of war. Mendes' direction and Deakins' cinematography were some of the best you'll see, making 1917 the finest WWI movie I've ever seen.\"},\n",

The plot is rather simple: deliver a letter across enemy lines or else thousands will die. It's straightforward and the action moves quickly.One area that I appreciate about this film is the respect it pays to WWI. Special attention is given to the hell-like conditions that the soldiers had to face. 1917 does an excellent job showing how the Great War turned normal men into savages. It also did a great job showing the life-and-death conditions that people faced.But, there were times I felt disconnected from the film. Is it from the dizzying speed the camera moves around? Is it the lack of character development and cheesy dialogue? Is it from the rather cliche plot? I felt no real connection to the characters until close to the end. Shame that this movie was missing that special something.1917 is a good movie to watch. Yet, I wouldn't call it too memorable. With a bit more polishing, this could have been a much stronger movie.3/5 or 3.5/5. Average or above average.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Sam Mendes' 1917 is a masterclass of filmmaking. With an Oscar-winning director and every famous British actor in smaller roles, 1917 does something unprecedented in a genre filled with masterpieces. It manages to tell a fresh story with breathtaking bravura. Featuring impeccably executed tracking shots, amazing soundtrack and beautiful cinematography - courtesy of the legendary Roger Deakins - 1917 stands as arguably the best World War I film, as well as one of the best war films ever made.The element that makes this film so unique is the long tracking shots. The film is made to look like one continuous take. Thanks to modern CGI, there are unnoticeable cuts in the film. But the execution of the film cannot be understated. The long takes, the authenticity, and practical sets add so much realism and intensity to the story that they make every frame immensely gripping. Never has there been a film about war, with such incredible and ambitious camerawork like 1917. Films exist to show, not tell, what an experience would be like. They emphasize tricking the audience for a split second, making them think they are there too. 1917 manifests this near perfectly.A drawback to the tracking shot format is that it does not capture the whole scope of battle. The format makes the audience's vision into this world limited, albeit, that vision is still epic, and breathtaking nonetheless. A film that showcases a truly epic scope with edits to multiple camera angles is Dunkirk. Though that film would have felt more complete if CGI was used to enhance the background and further surroundings. The only real complaint is during the night city sequence, George Mackay's character is running from German gunfire. He zigzags and evades bullets. The aim of the German soldiers is unrealistically bad. Perhaps a case of stormtrooper aim, but in a film so dead set on authenticity and realism, this did require a suspension of disbelief, if only for a brief moment.Two scenes that illustrate the power of the filmmaking craft are the night window scene, and the running scene. These two scenes showcase that transportive and magical feeling that the cinema can provide. The night window scene features beautiful cinematography, breathtaking visuals, and an amazing score. When those three things come perfectly together, an operatic sensationalism floods the screen. The running scene may be the most epic running in cinematic history. Yes, even better than Forrest Gump and Tom Cruise. The build-up to the running felt as realistic as the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan. These were two truly magical scenes.1917 is movie magic. It captures the thrilling, intense, and awe-inspiring resplendent of war. It truly felt like we the audience were in this moment. 1917 is more than a gimmick, but a powerhouse of filmmaking and raw visceral power.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"If there was some form of MVP award for cinematic achievements that had taken place over the last 12 months, I'm positive that many would agree a worthy winner of one such award would be legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose work here alongside director Sam Mendes on 1917 is some of the most technically marvelous and creative that you're ever likely to see in the movie making medium.Sharing more in common with fellow war set thriller Dunkirk than more traditional war films such as Hacksaw Ridge or Saving Private Ryan, 1917 sees Mendes and his team of behind the scenes superstars and on-song actors unleash a rather simplistic men on a mission type race against time pulse racer that becomes something truely special thanks to the craftmanship on show that is of the highest order you'd ever hope to see.Much fuss has been made already before 1917 was ever released concerning it's one shot like execution, a magic trick of sorts that ensures viewers are gripped from the moment we join Dean-Charles Chapman's and George MacKay's British Lance Corporal in the muddy and body filled tranches of Europe in World War 1 as they are tasked with going behind enemy lines to deliver a life changing message to a certain death bound battalion of English soldiers.It's a directional and design choice that might on paper seem gimmicky or even distracting in theory but Mendes and Deakins employ it in such a way in 1917 that is captivating without ever being in any way, shape or form a decision that feels cocky or unwarranted.There are many moments throughout this cinematic marvel where your jaw will lay agasp at what you have just witnessed, a frantic run across a battle field or foot race through a German occupied broken cityscape just some such occurances, but it's never pulled off in a way that takes us out of the plight of the two Lance Corporals as they face a seemingly insurmountable task.As the two likeable central figures, rising stars Chapman and MacKay both excel in what are both likely to be star making turns and their respective performances are the unsung heroes of the piece that would've been a piece of creative genius but nothing more had these two performers not been able to bring Mendes heartfelt and deceptively emotive tale to life through their important roles.They are at the end of the day both impressive cogs in a feature filled with some of the modern era's finest cinematic construction, a crowning achievement for a director and his cinematographer who have both enhanced their already glowing reputations with this unforgettable exercise.Final Say -A war set thriller that is alive with energy, heart and technical wizardry, 1917 is a mind blowingly good cinematic creation that will be a deserving Oscar king should the cards fall that way on Hollywood's night of nights. A must watch on the biggest screen available to your viewing needs.5 milk filled canteens out of 5\"},\n",

Just not by the lead actor(s), who is (are) instantly forgettable . So forgettable, you have to remind yourself it's still the same character ( 2 of those for part of the film ) after you blinked .There also are a few very nice shots and beautifully put together locations .\\nIt's a shame that the camera work and editing is so poorly done, you never really get a good sense ot them .It's an ongoing theme - the viewer never gets involved in the scenery, the story, the action, the mediocre attempts at adding depth to some situations .\\nAnd certainly not in the main characters, who appear like interns from catering were cast .As for the one-shot thing , it worked in a few scenes .\\nThe technique was developed to add dynamics and/or density to scenes, that were usually fairly sort, a complex piece of a more complex overall concept .Here, the creators chose to go the easy way, and just threw that technique at the entire movie , whether it made sense or not .Apart from the film NOT being done in one single shot - for those who were fooled into thinking so - it also only works in a few scenes, and severly compromises the rest of the movie .\\nAnd even in those 'good' scenes. it really isn't very well done, and wasn't worth the effort . Mainly because it was a lazy, incompetent effort, the writing didn't match the camera work, and they just didn't try very hard .Above all, the movie is boring .\\nIt's an unimaginative , cold and stage like presentation; stereotypical, stale and again - completely uninvolving .But at least we now know that the one-shot thing can be done very wrong - even when it's a fake - and should be used for different projects, and by better skilled creators .\"},\n",

The whole film is a tissue of lies wrapped around falsehoods boxed in a laughably comic deceit that a Corporal is going to rush through no man's land in 1917!Utter nonsense form start to finish. and that's before you get to the non existent character development, the poor acting and the lame script.Without a doubt the very worst war movie I have ever seen.\"},\n",

I did not realize that this would become on of my favorite of the genre and just how much I would love it. This movie captures what real soldiers of the time must have felt. It drives home the idea that these soldiers werent out their just looking for a kill. These guys were people with friends and family and just wanted to keep them safe and see them again. The camaraderie between Blake and Schofield can be felt from the beginning. The movie takes off from the start but you can tell these two men have a friendship that has been through the worst of war. The movies really shows that none of these men are particularly in this war for glory. They are here to do their job and get home. Except for one man (late in the movie). The dialogue throughout isnt some grand speeches or long winded monologues, its straight and to the point but in a beautifully told way that again emphasizes the situation. The main characters convey such emotion visually as well. It's almost like you can feel it yourself. The actual filming itself is amazing as well. They have these long continuous shots that really keep you on edge and engaged in the movies well. You literally follow these men's entire journey and it connects you with the main characters even more. This is definitely a movie that is worth seeing more than a couple times.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"My review of 1917.In short you must see this film. I don't say this because I have a passing interest in World War 1 nor because I think war is good. No. See this because it highlights extremely accurately a war that now only lives in silent black and white, distant documentary or the written word. It highlights is terror, sadness and pointlessness.Now there are some inaccuracies which manly focus on geography but I won't dwell on them as to point it out and spoil it. If you know Northern France it's obvious.On the matter of mud, of course the whole of World War 1 was fought in the wet and mud even in high summer (a common misconception) the majority of the film is mud free and this is accurate. The chalk pit of guns and chalk tunnels are also near identical to the same areas found in France today.The inital trench scene and crossing into No Mans Land is, I would say, perfectly represented. You can almost smell death. Google images of No Mans Land or trenches after an attack after you have seen the film to appreciate how well it has been created. That is how hundreds of square miles of France and Belgium looked.Note the difference between the British frontline and the German frontline at the start. Well thought out.The camera work is second to none. The characters portray the stress and tension of war extremely well. And given there are few characters it is remarkable that this is acheived.The score never over powers and adds when there is little or no dialog.The relationship between the two main characters, I think, doesn't go to set out and be the focus. The get on as they have been through so much and are just trying to survive. The rescue of the German pilot isn't discussed as to whether they should help the enemy on war morals; they rescue him as they don't want to a man suffer and try to do their best for him.The final scene of men going over the top and the running Schofield can be considered epic and a cinematic master piece. You feel every explosion and every frustration.Thought this maybe a controversial to say, we finally have a war film that does not portray US troops in any theater or war or big name US actors in lead roles. No cigar chomping. No cliched story of a loved one back home. No bravado. No satisfactory ending.It is a true to life (with some Hollywood) war film that covers a relatively little known period of Britians Great War effort (compared to say the Somme or Ypres). It has been filmed with care but does not shy away from the filth and terror and showing terrible injuries that come to mind when remembering the 14-18 conflict.It is worth seeing and then exploring what happened in 1917 as thankfully the film does not set out to educate in this way.\"},\n",

With regards to the best war film ever made, seriously? What idiots write this utter nonsense? Better than Platoon, Full metal jacket, yes those are vietnam. Well its not a patch on Dunkirk, saving private Ryan, the longest day, battle of the bulge, where eagles dare, guns of navarone, the list is endless but for a modern day adaptation of WW1 or WW2, this isn't a patch on Dunkirk. Maybe as this is based on WW1 and there hasn't been many examples to compare, this might be why people are raving about it? If that's the case, warhorse was way way better. I just don't get it as to why this is so widely acclaimed. I was so so looking forward to this and I was left utterly utterly disappointed to say the least. Worth a watch but nothing more\"},\n",

The franchise era should tossed on the scrap heap of history and be as quickly forgotten as it arose. Either that or relegate it to online streaming platforms that cater to the comatose masses. I sadly saw the last Star Wars installment a week before seeing this 1917. I thought I'd never go to the cinema again (it had been two years without a visit).

The music, acting, set pieces, etc are all pretty much flawless, and the tracking shot technique works wonderfully.

The idea of making the film as if it was one single shot is brillant. Thank you Roger Deakins ! The cast is more than weel-chosen since the two lead actors are truly talented ans their emotions are not faked. I had goosebumps while whatching at most of the scenes. It exactly embodies the emotions of the war: brotherhood, courage, fear and anger and it takes you in the reality of war. The fighting scenes are as breathtaking as they are atrocious, it almost gives you the urge to jump out of your seat to run through the battle field and help those poor soldiers. Actually, I did not really want to see the movie. I was afraid it was just going to be another war movie with a soldier sacrificing himself, a fight and a happy end. But I am glad I went to see this movie during my English class. This movie is so much more than just a war movie and SPOILERS ALERT even if there is a happy end, we can see and understand that after all, this is not a victory, it is just a ma, who fulfills a mission and who has to go back to the battlefields. 1917 is a must see movie and I promise you, you won't be disappoited.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"1917\" sits somewhere between \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"The Revenant\" story-wise, even if can\\'t match the sheer dramatic ferocity of either of those two films. The first half hour or so is essentially an exercise in perfectly executed tension, but after that the film becomes a bit more uneven. Basically, the movie could\\'ve used a few cuts to propel its sometimes slowing story (e.g. scenes in the truck, an encounter with a French woman, etc). While this movie is pitched as a single shot, it actually has a deliberate edit roughly midway through (involving a blackout), and could\\'ve used a few more. Still, Deakins\\'s cinematography is stunning and even when the story lags the images we see are quite striking. But ultimately, in its two hours, the movie doesn\\'t generate enough dramatic tension, particularly as it inches towards its ending, which kind of fizzles. The payoff to this cinematic feat is, without any spoilers, unsurprising, familiar, and typical of so many other war films - it\\'s unfortunate that so much work went into the craft of its production but more didn\\'t go into developing the characters and building up the story.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"With the re-opening of cinemas took the opportunity to watch this again and must say it's still breathtaking despite 3rd viewing! And I'm not even a war movie fan.I felt the war only served as context and backdrop. Above all it's a compelling piece of storytelling, and a very personal one too. To be precise, a grandfather story - from director Sam Menses' own grandfather who served in World War I. Mendes of course is better known as film director for two recent James Bond movies - Skyfall and Spectre.This one however is a completely different genre. There were hardly any battle scenes with the handful being only one-to-one engagement with the enemy, even then only upon being discovered or stumbling upon them and in one scene the protagonist was actually trying to save the enemy. So there was a massive dose of humanity in the film.I also love the way the protagonist was subtly changed midway through the film. And if either protagonist did not captivate you, I think the cameos might just. Particularly in order or appearance, Colin Firth as the emphatic General who took a shrewd gamble, Andrew Scott as the utterly cynical, skeptic Lieutenant in the trench, Mark Strong as the Captain whose parting shot was probably the most crucial piece of advice in the film and finally Benedict Cumberbatch as the totally gobsmacked and gutted Colonel. Each cameo brief but devastatingly incisive in their delivery.I think this film might just be Mendes' magnum opus. With Roger Deakins' illuminating and ravishing cinematography as icing on the cake.\"},\n",

Sitting in a car and enjoying the artificial landscape along the established track, the event mechanism will be triggered continuously, and there will be a roller coaster like dive experience at the final climax. This film is basically like this. Everything is carefully designed and manipulated without any disguise. Dozens of scenes are forced to be stitched into one mirror to the end, as well as those special effects and settings. Such a superficial visual technology display is just like the Mcbeth movie, which is meaningless. Several famous actors in the game like NPC for the protagonist's card clearance is a play. A few perceptual strokes are quite eye-catching, which are the few perceptual moments for the characters to break through the technical rolling. The light and shadow design of the scene at night is wonderful.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Centering around 2 young Brittish soldiers, Blake and Schofield, tasked with a simple mission: cross enemy lines, into No Man's Land, and deliver a message to another battilion, countermanding an attack planned for the next day.Should the message not reach the batillion in time, 1,600 men (including Blake's brother) are likely to die at the hands of the Germans who lie waiting to spring their trap... With a refreshingly straightforward, momentum driven narrative, the audience is firmly placed in the trenches, alongside these soldiers as they make their way through the theatre of war.Director, Sam Mendes, and cinematographer, Roger Deakens, achieves this immersive feat by having shot the film to appear as one continous take, from a single viewpoint. The camera follows our heroes closely and without cutting away, through the entire, unrelenting experience - keeping the tension and dread squarely within focus.While the direction and camerawork is without a doubt a technical achievement, the stylistic choices could easily have been considered a gimmick, having the (ironically) adverse effect in taking its audience out of the experience. Thankfully, this is not the case, as the various facets of the production are seamlessly executed with mastery and care. This includes the gritty set pieces that will have your heart pounding at the same rate as the protagonists, holding your breath as they progress through booby trap laden trenches, enemy-infested buildings and perilous river waters.The film's casting should also be commended for having the restraint to put some of Britain's greatest thespians in the smallest of supporting roles. Instead, the film is led by two relatively unknown actors, giving the audience the opportunity to invest fully in the story and characters - without viewing it through the usual, artificial lens of A-list stars.Overall, the entire production is put together with a strong vision ans clear focus.\\nImmersive, hard hitting and unforgiving - an epic, in the grandest sense of the word. This one is not to be missed and demands to be experienced on the big screen. 10/10\"},\n",

But suddenly it becomes the responsibility of the fellow soldier to carry the honor and valor of his friend and fellow soldier. 1917 shows that the bond of friendship is stronger than the horror of War.\\n1917 never tries to make you choose sides, right or wrong in the war.

But now we've finally got one in the form of 1917.The story itself is decent although you could argue its not one of the best. But the way it is captured is what makes this movie a very good one.The single shot take works very well. It makes the journey throughout the movie more realistic and making it look like its in real time. The movie also had a lot of intense moments which worked better with the single shot technique.The movie deserves more credit for its cinematography, intensity and realism rather than the story and the history behind it. That was what made it a very good movie but just not one of the best. Having said that though, I do feel this is more in line with director Sam Mendes's forte compared to the James Bond movies. What he tried to do with Skyfall is achieved much better in 1917. Glad hes gone back to where his strengths are.\"},\n",

This entire film, in my opinion, has very purposeful elements throughout it. First off, the feel of the single-shot videography was great! The editing was top notch and I even had to question myself whether or not there were cuts in the photography or no at times, fantastic! Second, this movie had a great intentionality to it! The violence and actions were purposeful and weren't for the sake of themselves, but rather an accurate presentation of the sequences and events that occurred. You can really see the director's intention in the film clearly. The context and the presentation were executed very effectively, but be aware of its violence. The audience should be over 18 to be able to fully grasp the historical understanding of the film which is so impactful. Viewing in this lens, the film does an awesome job inspiring the audience through its main character Lance Schofield in his very heroic deeds throughout the film. His unconditional actions are absolutely rooted in fundamental truth, and his respect for people with his respectful attribution to his lost friend and soldier Lance Blake is beautiful and also inspiring. I personally was very inspired after the film and gained a much bigger appreciation for anyone who serves in the military, especially my godfather who served for many years in the marines. Overall, 1917 was a fantastic film which inspired me in a very positive way, and I know it will be doing the same for many others. I will be watching this film again very soon!\"},\n",

Based on a story from Mendes\\' own grandfather, 1917 moves at a compelling pace and includes some surprises along the way. As an audience member, I was moved to sympathize with the protagonist, but not to really \"love\" him - because we just did not know enough about his own story, or those of the other main characters engaged. It\\'s a shame, because the drama and the stakes of the resolution could not be higher - yet the table was not fully set for true \"transformation\". Instead, though, yes, we root for the hero, we don\\'t truly find ourselves moved to identify fully with him or those 1600 lives at stake and more.I enjoyed the film, but was not deeply impacted by it. It\\'s truly a missed opportunity on the 100th anniversary of WWI and the millions of stories still waiting to be told. To those who suffered during this horrific global conflict, I give all due respect. It is incumbent on us as storytellers to exploit our own skills to the fullest when given a $100 MM opportunity.My review: 7/10 stars.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"1917, if released before Jan 1, would have easily cracked my top 5 films of the year, and more than likely made it into my top films of the decade list as well. A brilliant display of filmmaking from top to bottom, an emotional ride in a war film that I haven't felt since probably Saving Private Ryan (but Dunkirk may have something to say about that), and simply one of the most visceral movie-going experiences I can ever remember having. The movie barely takes a second to breathe, and its during those few minutes that I often realized how sore my a** was from being stuck in the same viewing position for a good 45 minute stretch. Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes deserve a ton of credit for their insistence that the film be presented as if it were one-shot, when in fact it's more than likely around 8-12 long takes. It truly creates an environment in the theater that will be hard to replicate. And even the lead performances and bit parts from well-known actors are extremely well handled and meticulously crafted. Make no mistake, 1917 is an absolute masterpiece.10/10\"},\n",

This film brings you deep in the trenches of humanity, capturing the emotion of two young boys adventuring through a brutal warfare to complete a rather small but lifesaving mission. Having the film look like a one-take, it makes you feel like you are in the journey itself and somewhat like a video game movie. It's definitely worth the watch!\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"9.6/10.This movie was an amazing journey from beginning to end. We are introduced to Lance Corporal Blake and Lance Corporal Schofield. We follow as they go through hell and misery to deliver a message to a battalion on the other side of the front lines of the British and German battlefields of World War I. The Soundtracks, set pieces, and cinematography was some of the best I've seen in war movies. The entire movie is shot In a single like shot with cuts masked beautifully which is impossible to spot sometimes. The ending was a pure masterpiece with Schofield running across the battlefield to get to Colonel Mackenzie played by Benedict Cumberbatch to stop the advance on the enemy. The last scene between Blake's older brother and Schofield was heartbreaking. Overall an S-tier movie.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I love war movies, the classics Saving Private Ryan and We Were Soldiers and newer films like Hacksaw Ridge. With Sam Mendes(Skyfall) directing, an interesting shooting style and a compelling trailer I was hyped up but left the cinema a little unsatisfied.\\nThe story centres around two young soldiers who are given the task of delivering a message to a battalion ordering them to call off an attack, as to avoid a trap by enemy troops and a subsequent massacre.\\nThe way this Is filmed is through one continuous camera shot, of course there are tricks to hide takes but it is an impressive feat. Not only for the actors to give a physical performance climbing through bunkers and avoiding enemy fire but to remember their lines and for the crew to keep this up so smoothly, I give this movie massive credit for this.\\nThe first act of this film is by far the high point for me, we go through the trenches, into a bunker to collect orders then across to the end of the line and through no mans land eventually into a German bunker. It took my breath away how smoothly the camera navigated through this uneven terrain, all the while keeping the shot steady and framed. The tension was there as you can imagine crossing into enemy territory and I was enjoying the film.\\nHowever, problems arises when you don't cut from the main characters. When they have to walk to a barn for example we get the entire shot of them walking to the barn. I understand your probably thinking this is supposed to emulate their lives and what their experiencing, I understand but as a film with not much dialogue or charisma from the leads, not any Tarantino style conversations or music playing it drags the movie out.\\nNot only does the film have a lot of filler, the main characters don't have the acting or charm to carry the weight of this film. In a movie like The Revenant, it worked because it was filmed stylishly and Leo is a phenomenal actor.\\nMaybe it was just me but I just wasn't rooting for the heroes of this film, I don't think they go through enough or have any backstory explored to give them depth and they don't g through any real character arcs.\\nWhile I'm not complaining about the lack of action, it is missing here for a war movie. With this camera style there was the option to get something really special with some sequences but it never comes.\\nIt's not to say the film is lacking any tension or suspense. It comes every now and then, but it's was not enough to keep me invested. I think if you have seen your fair share of the genre this doesn't bring anything new, it's nothing you won't have seen before.\\nTo summarise I don't think 1917 is a bad movie, it's really not. Technically it's superb and the set up could of made this special. However I think the style chosen for this was a double edged sword, it gives great tension at times but drags the film down majorly at others. Combine this with an underwhelming performance from the lead actors just takes the film out of becoming a classic and drops it into the slightly above average category.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The message of this movie is as great as it's cinematography.This film is about Perseverance through hard times and fulfilling your duty.\\nBecause of the plot and it's message it appeals to any good-willing man, who seeks to do the right thing even in the hardest of circumstances; to anyone trying to make the most out of their lives.It also appeals to the average cineast because of its cinematography. The one-take method and the position of the camera gives you an intimate relation to the main characters as they struggle to complete their mission, fulfill their destiny, and become great.\\nThe plot is flawless, as the characters and their development.\\nFor example, in the beginning Will Schofield gets angry at his friend for choosing him to go on the mission; he's scared. But as the movie progresses he pushes through the difficulties and finishes the mission. He also goes above and beyond: he doesn't rest until he has fulfilled his friend's death wish.\\nIt's also historically accurate: even the ammo capacity of the Lee Enfield Mk was realistic, I'm no historian but I didn't notice any blatant laws.In conclusion, it's historically accurate WW1 movie with superb cinematography, flawless plot as well as characters, and a great message.I recommend it to all men, specially young men who seek virtue, and for women and young women so they know what to look for in a man.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I was lucky to attend a preview screening of this for almost nothing. War movies are never my first choice. They either seem to be glorified body counts using high tech killing machines or preachy \"isn\\'t war just terrible and we should all be ashamed\" movies. This one is in the latter camp. This is a saving private Ryan style narrative minus the pyrotechnics of the opening scene. Two soldiers are selected to pass a message to a commander to halt and advance into a planned trap. The movie itself is basically about their journey and the overall emotion it conveys is one of tension. The problem I had with the movie is that the soldiers are basically inept. Every problem that they face is basically self inflicted and the result of bad decision making. Which makes it a little hard to be sympathetic. This is really a story about dumb luck and who does or doesn\\'t have it.\\nIt\\'s well shot however it has less visual impact than the recent Peter Jackson effort which used real moving film. Which brings me to my next point. The tone of 1917 is very sombre while as the Peter Jackson documentary showed that wasn\\'t always the case. For some reason its forbidden to show anyone smiling over anything in world war 1. This will earn high praise from the anti war middle-class that\\'s lovely cinematography crowd. But many will be disappointed when the movie doesn\\'t match the initial high scores of professional critics. Midway was a much more entertaining and emotionally engaging war movie.'},\n",

    "Из графика видно, что самой популярной оценкой является оценка 10 (около 1000 отзывов), также около 700 пользователей оценили фильм на 9. Далее идет плавный спуск - чем меньше оценка, тем меньше количество таких отзывов. Таким образом, видна довольно сильная несбалансированность в данных. Далее будет применены `random oversampling` и `random undersampling` для перебалансировки классов с целью улучшить данные для обучения модели"

    "Так как рассматриваемый фильм является военным, ождаемо, самым популярным словом в отзывах является war. Кроме того, популярными словами являются story, scene и plot, что говорит о качественном сценарии и постановке. Также пользователи часто отмечают персонажей и актеров. Также довольно крупным является словосочетание \"one shot\", \"camera\" и \"cut\", что говорит о том, что пользователи часто отмечают операторскую работу и тот факт, что фильм снят одним кадром и все склейки кадров замаскированы."

    "У всех четырех моделей примерно сопоставимые по качеству предсказания. Видно, что наиболее удачные оценки для предсказания во всех моделях это оценки 2, 3, 4, 5. Это можно объяснить тем, что в изначальной выборке отзывов с данными оценками было мало и нужно было использовать Underesampling и Oversampling. Это приводит к тому, что как в трейновой так и в тестовой выборке есть некоторое количество одинаковых отзывов, что и способствует улучшению оценки (что на самом деле не является полноценным показателем эффективности, ведь модель по сути училась на каком то количестве повторяющихся отзывов). В целом по метрикам результат довольно высокий, лучший у метода опорных векторов и случайного леса."

Далее идет градиентный бустинг и наивный Байесовский классификатор с результатами 0.82 и 0.81 соответсвтенно. Самое быстрое время выполнения у навиного байесовского классификатора - более чем в 1000 раз быстрее чем у ближайшего по быстроте метода, соотвественно, при необходимости достижения масимальной скорости данный метод - лучший вариант. Самый долгий метод - градиентный бустинг - в 10000 раз медленнее, чем самый быстрый метод. В общем, наилучшие результаты по совокупности показателей (скорость выполнения и результат) у метода Random Forest - наивысшая точность и довольно маленькое время выполнения."
