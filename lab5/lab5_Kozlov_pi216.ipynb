       "  'Текст отзыва': '6.7/10While \"Nope\" is a visual spectacle I found that it didn\\'t sit as well as I would\\'ve hoped when it came to the story. However, it still manages to reach its goal of entertaining on some level.The film felt slightly long due to the first and third acts feeling fast and somewhat stuffed with a lot of goings ons while the second act felt very slow and drawn out. The long parts put me into a state of boredom, and even further than that, once the reveal of the antagonist happened, the magic and tension disappeared. Before that tension disappeared I found there was some good tension built up due to the soundtrack, but again, things fell short.As for the horror parts, I assumed there would be more than just the ones shown in the commercial, and while there was, again a lot of the horror/magic disappeared once the antagonist was shown.I did find the acting to be very engaging. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer each brought great energy to their roles, and the supporting actors were equally enjoyable.Overall, a decent film, but if I could go back I would wait to see it on a cheap night. Acting was enjoyable, the cinematography was spectacular, but the story, the length of the film, and the antagonist weren\\'t up to the par I was expecting.Thank you for reading my review.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Original, creative, creepy and suspenseful. Jordan Peele continues to show off his skills as a director. From a technical perspective, this is top-notch across the board. The way sound is strategically used is masterful. My only downsides with the movie are the comedy not always working (not as much as with Get Out), and it taking a little while to get going. But after really disliking Us, I see this as a major bounce-back.I strongly recommend avoiding trailers or any plot details. I went in knowing absolutely nothing other than \"Jordan Peele.\" Going through the story as it unfolds and discovering what it\\'s about is such a fun experience. I also recommend seeing it in IMAX since some scenes have an expanded aspect ratio. If not IMAX then any premium screen that will enhance the sound and images.EDIT: I liked Nope even better on second viewing. I noticed so many little details as well as repeated references to the main theme, resulting in a much better flow. And I didn\\'t feel any slowness early in the movie like I did the first time, possibly because I was expecting it and knew it was worth it. Changing rating from 7 to 8 stars. (2 viewings, opening Thursday IMAX 7/21/2022, IMAX 8/3/2022)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSThis movie reminds me a lot of Signs. The way the suspense levels are through the roof in the horror moments. The way the movie is so confined with a small cast, yet feels huge. And the way various story elements and details come together at the end, with credit going to good writing. After making this connection, I found out that Jordan Peele specifically said Signs was one of his inspirations for Nope.Once I realized the movie is about aliens, I started wondering what direction they would go for the look of the aliens. We\\'ve seen so many versions that it\\'s difficult to come up with something new or creative. But instead of the typical humanoid creatures or something like Zerg from StarCraft or Starship Troopers, he goes in a completely different direction with the entire UFO being a single alien being. Talk about thinking outside the box. When it opens up during the climax, it looks incredible.Also, I was so happy/impressed when I realized the climax would take place during daytime so we could see everything.The part with the chimp does not seem vital to the plot (at first glance, at least). This would normally be a downside, but I think there are two reasons it works. One is that the scene is unbelievably creepy and jaw-dropping. And two, it does connect to a couple themes. It parallels the alien behavior with predatory tendencies, being territorial, and not looking it in the eyes. And the irony of Jupe doing the same thing as an adult as he did as a child, dealing with a beast he couldn\\'t control, once again resulting in disaster.There is probably a lot more to be explored. I look forward to watching it again and then checking out some explained/explored videos on youtube.EDIT: I am writing this before watching any explored videos. On second viewing, I noticed the theme of not being able to control a beast is touched on throughout the movie, even as early as the commercial shoot. Same with the theme of spectacle/wanting to be seen. I didn\\'t make all the connections the first time.I originally didn\\'t think much of the shoe standing up. But they show it a few times, intentionally. And I don\\'t believe there is evidence of anything supernatural. So that got me thinking. And I have a theory.The probability of a nickel landing on its side is estimated to be one in 6,000. It seems almost impossible. But if you drop a nickel repeatedly, it\\'s not only probable, it\\'s nearly inevitable. As number of drops goes to infinity, probability of landing on its side goes to 100%.If we assume that\\'s what the shoe represents, how does it connect to the movie? Apply that same logic to the theme of not being able to control a beast. No matter how well-tamed, no matter how long you\\'ve built trust, no matter how unlikely it is for something to cause it to become ultra aggressive, on a long enough timeline it becomes an inevitability.I could be way off, but it\\'s cool to think about.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"Nope\" is the next disappointment by Jordan Peele who, with each movie, seems to look more and more like a one hit wonder. \"Get Out\" was an incredible thriller that fired on every cylinder and hit every note; \"Us\" had a phenomenal trailer, but seemed to confuse audiences with its convoluted and borderline pretentious ending where, the more you think about things, the less sense they make. \"Nope\" follows that same vein, and I can\\'t help but think that Peele feels as if he needs to shock and awe when, perhaps, a more simple, straightforward tale would have worked better.\"Nope\" is two hours and ten minutes long, so you could say that this isn\\'t a short, breezy film. And I don\\'t necessarily have a problem with that. The problem is, however, that \"Nope\" doesn\\'t have much to say, do, or tell within that lengthy run time. A slow burn to its very core, \"Nope\" takes its sweet time setting up the story that it wants to tell - scratch that, though, because there isn\\'t much of a story here in the first place. If you\\'ve seen the second trailer for this film, you know that it\\'s about two ranchers who seem to witness an unidentified flying object in the skies above and, as they are both down on their luck and strapped for cash, they decide to set up some cameras in hopes of capturing said UFO on film so they can sell the footage. An interesting, if bare bones, premise to be sure, but surely one that gives way to the real meat, hook, and plot of the film, no?Nope. The story never gets any grander or more unique than its initial set up. Sure, there is a subplot that is, granted, pretty intense, leading to a few unique and twisted scenes, but it hardly adds anything to the movie except an added running time. Without spoilers, the subplot has to do with a certain animal; while I understood what they were going for, I couldn\\'t help but wonder why the scenes didn\\'t get cut in editing to create a tighter, more focused story, as I imagine the entire point of the subplot will fly over the heads of many.The simple premise wouldn\\'t be a problem if the film led to a bombastic and satisfying conclusion, but it doesn\\'t. Throwing its simple premise out the window to instead attempt to surprise audiences with a twist that is somehow more underwhelming than my life, \"Nope\" devolves into a parody of itself by the end. I don\\'t want to spoil anything, but I do want to say that the final act reveal takes all mystery, suspense, tension, and horror out of the picture completely - I literally couldn\\'t believe my eyes; I mean, who thought what they did would be a good idea on any level, especially visually? Let\\'s just say that, in this case, less would have been more.\"Nope\" was a disappointment to me, and is further proof that Jordan Peele is - sadly - becoming a one hit wonder. A tighter, more streamlined and focused story would\\'ve worked wonders here, especially in helping to create the horror film that this movie was advertised as being. It pains me to say, however, that viewers may not find the contents of the film horrifying as much as they may find themselves scared of \"Nope\\'s\" utter mediocrity.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Jordan Peele's Nope has been compared to a Spielberg extravaganza such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Conceptually it is closer to M Night Shyamalan. With a central premise about fame.Some of the characters have been involved in the tv and film industry. Others are chasing fame such as news and reality tv.OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is a rancher and horse wrangler. Together with his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) they need to do something about their struggling business after the sudden death of their father who was hit by some falling debris.There are the strange death of their horses. They have had to sell some horses to their neighbour Ricky 'Jupe' Park (Steven Yeun) a former child actor who now operates a Western theme park.The possibility of UFO activity out there could be the sibling's salvation. Hoping to recapture footage of the impossible could be a way to make a fortune.Like a Shyamalan movie, Nope is told in a leisurely pace like some modern western before the horror/sci fi part cranks up.It is not without flaws. I am bemused why Emerald sounds like some person who grew up in the hood. It is jarring.When the alien attacks takes place, there is a lack of law enforcement, army and media activity.Jupe's past as a child actor where a chimpanzee went on a rampage sits oddly. It was like walking into a David Lynch film.Nope is odd, stilted and strangely beguiling. It is hard to overlook the flaws.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I surmise that the idea for \"Nope\" came out of a clever idea for a sketch. Imagine a film where the main character says \"Nope\" to terrifying, unexplainable phenomena instead of rushing forward like a courageous, but dumb movie hero.Except, bucking that trope only takes a movie so far. And that\\'s the point where the movie \"Nope\" starts to unravel, when it can\\'t adequately explain why the protagonists are sticking around.Somewhere between halfway and three fourths of the movie, the dialogue just becomes far too cryptic to make sense of. And that\\'s the point where the actions the protagonists are taking really needs to be clear, as it\\'s the climax of the film.I wished the director Jordan Peele, one half of the successful Key and Peele comedy duo, would try his hand at the horror/comedy movie genre. I believe this is his third and latest film, and the second one that most fits in that genre.To his credit, some sequences have great cinematography, tension, and horror. And some moments are really funny. One particular sequence is both terrifying and hilarious, and best encapsulates the title \"Nope,\" as a main character goes head to head with a massive, intimidating force and just closes his car door, and says \"nope.\"But overall, the horror and comedy sides do not feel totally woven together. It\\'s like at some point budget was lost and some sequences just couldn\\'t get follow through. And the characters had to be stretched to make up for missing plot points, or fill the moments with comedy. The writers and actors and visual effects teams are good enough so they manage it. But there is a sense of \"what did I just watch\" at the ending, which wasn\\'t there with Peele\\'s two other more finished films.Whatever the back story is that has given \"Nope\" its rough landing, I still found the film enjoyable. Sometimes experimental. Mostly unpretentious and original good fun. But also, what did I just watch?'},\n",

That's one of the obvious things Jordan Peele is telling us in Nope, and I loved how gradual he was in doing that through what seemed to be disparate story lines in the horses and chimp. He was also wise in not fully explaining the alien, which I thought made it scarier, and scenes like the one where it swoops down on Daniel Kaluuya riding his horse were brilliantly rendered. Along the way he touches on the insatiable desire of humans to capture things on film, starting from Muybridge's earliest work, as well as the crass ways they commercialize things, including the cheesy tv show with its applause sign, the mad magazine and SNL spoofs of a horrifying event, and the outdoor show which proved that Steven Yeun's character didn't learn his lesson. The only drawback for me was in the film's length; I thought it could have been tightened up and shorter. Otherwise, brilliantly conceived, great cast, layered meaning, and a fun ride.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'It starts off a little humorous, thought the directing was great to take it from there into a more tense, on edge film. I however don\\'t think this is horror, more of sci-fi but unlike sci-fi movies this one didn\\'t really expose much of the otherworldly parts of it, which was great in the beginning because it built up suspense but since we don\\'t learn much about the \"alien\" you\\'re left with more questions than answers which annoyed me. Thought the premise of the movie was going to be hard to pull off since it\\'s set in the middle of nowhere but they did. Story telling is good and paced well, I love how they added the chimpanzee story arc but I\\'m disappointed that was the most gruesome part in the movie. You don\\'t get to see how the alien got there, why OJ somehow figured it\\'s territorial, what is actually happening inside the ship, or how Jupe and his wife\\'s circus ruckus never stirred up more attention on previous occasions.... in short, it lacks depth and I think it would have elavated it from just a good movie to a great one.The performances were amazing, loved how calm Kaluya\\'s character was, felt realistic for me. It\\'s often said black people don\\'t usually feature in horrors because once something\\'s fishy we dip, but if we didn\\'t I think this was a more realistic take by the whole cast, upped the rating for me. Peele\\'s concept and directing was great, it was great to see a horror that\\'s not leaning on jump-scares. But as I said this isn\\'t a horror, not in the typical sense of making you scared to turn off the lights to sleep; but it\\'s the nearest genre you could put it in other than sci-fi. I think movies like this, or The invisible man, Ready or not, Midsommer, Fresh, maybe even Us aren\\'t really horrors and a sub genre should be found; because you expect to be scared when you watch a horror so it feels mis-categorized. Nope felt more like a psychological sci-fi thriller or drama than actual horror.There was a good movie in here, it just needed more development and depth to go along with everything else the movie did right, it\\'s like when you have a brilliant idea but don\\'t think it through in detail so it just comes off shallow.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The biggest praise I can give is the cinematography and camera work. I really enjoy looking at wide shots of landscapes and the slow or sudden movements of the camera pushing the tension and anxiety of the scene without having to rely on dialogue or even any acting.I think the film will be divisive among its audience though. I think this is due to a couple of reasons. First, the story progression feels confusing at times to what we are used to seeing in a thriller or horror. I think labelling it as horror will automatically steer away some people while those that enjoys horror may be disappointed that it lacks enough scares to be called a horror. The trailer I feel also gives away too much and puts the film in a box that might detract viewers. Ultimately, you really have to be open-minded going to this movie. In respect to the genre, Nope really isn't a horror, but more of a blend of some sci-fi, some mystery, some comedy, and luckily, no romance.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. I think for movie lovers this will generally be a good experience. Peele seem to focus more on our shared love for films more than sticking to a particular formula of a single genre. There are many small things you'll enjoy if you already love movies, but it will probably have a visibly different experience to a casual movie goer.The themes of the film is also a good one, I feel. It feels like a cautionary modern fairy tale and the somewhat real dangers of chasing fame and disrespecting nature.Jordan Peele is shaping out to be a director whose name alone will generate an audience and I would put Nope as a more captivating experience than Us, and around the same level as Get Out despite being two very different stories. His vision and creativity continues to remain highly interesting and I'm so curious to find out what he goes to work on next!\"},\n",

Peele is pointing a mirror up to you and the most ironic part is a lot of don\\'t even seem to notice. No, this isn\\'t a typical horror movie. It\\'s more of a Spielbergian blockbuster satire with some amusing moments sprinkled throughout. The \"entity\" is creative and can be quite terrifying. The cinematography is top notch and probably the standout feature of the film, while Kaluuya can say an immense amount without even speaking a word. The screenplay is odd to say the least, but it hits more than it misses.While I still think this is a lesser film than Get Out or Us and it ran a little too long, you have to commend its originality in a summer sea of IP-based films. Peele attempts something profound and unique here, which should be respected regardless of your thoughts on the film.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Simple start to this review, this is film is complete rubbish. Here\\'s why:Terrible pacing.Showing people doing nothing with no purpose, not moving the plot forwards or developing the story or characters is boring, simple as that. The whole first 40 mins could be removed, and no one would notice.Terrible characters.Spending time with Em, would be like spending the weekend using a pair of cheese graters as headphones. What an annoying character she was. The male chap, a man that looked like a constipated person on suicide watch, who had listened to too many Morrissey records. He was about as interesting as listening to an 8-hour insurance seminar.The Plot.The main characters motivation is to get some money, well, so why spend a fortune on camera equipment? Does anyone believe a photo of an alien craft (as they thought it was) would make money, there are plenty on the internet.Lack of logic/Believability.For some reason this creature for the most part hides in a cloud and picks off a couple of horses, not to raise any suspicion. By the end of the film, it is zooming around in clear daylight, not giving a jot about being seen.Don\\'t Knows (you must imagine the \"don\\'t know\" is said in a sarcastic drawn-out way).How did it get there, how long has it been there, can it reproduce.... Don\\'t know.It only affects electrical devices as it flies over them, okay so film it from a far, with a zoom lens, problem solved, why don\\'t they do this? Don\\'t know.At one point it turns into a cross between a camp lampshade and a tissue paper exhibition, why, for what reason.... Don\\'t know.It decides to throw up/relieve itself on a small house in the middle of nowhere, why... Don\\'t know.It doesn\\'t attack people if they don\\'t look at it, wouldn\\'t that make it very easy to deal with then? Why did it attack the man with the silver helmet then.... Don\\'t know.Why would Jupe have a \"show\" to meet the aliens, how did he know about them, why didn\\'t he mention it to anyone, didn\\'t he think about the potential danger.... Don\\'t know.Why does the creature hang around the place with the least amount of its food source.... Don\\'t know.I could go on an on. What is shocking, are the arrogant pretentious reviews, \"you didn\\'t get it\". I go to see a movie to be entertained/surprised/moved/informed. I don\\'t go to see a movie to be boring, silly, and empty, but is really meant to be symbolic/allegorical/existential, so therefore I should review it as brilliant, even if it sends most people to sleep.We can all pretend any poor film was meant to be mean this that and the other, it was badly made crap, stop trying to make excuses.What\\'s next, Plan 9 From Outer Space, was genius representing the struggle of communism against the West.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Greetings again from the darkness. With his first two films, GET OUT (2017) and US (2019), writer-director-producer Jordan Peele already has an Oscar and has firmly established himself as one of the most innovative and visionary filmmakers working today. He has entered the revered class of directors whose new films are automatically \\'must see\\'. This is in spite of our knowing full well that he doesn\\'t strive for mass accessibility, and typically seems less focused on character development and more focused on what\\'s happening to those characters and how they react. Mr. Peele\\'s latest is a unique blend of Science Fiction, Horror, and Comedy, with a dose of horses, UFOs, and box store employees. At its core, the film is about chasing the spectacle of a spectacle, so that one might become a spectacle themself.A cold opening is a bit of \\'found footage\\' from a horrific event on the set of a TV show featuring a chimp named Gordy. We have no idea how this fits in to what we are about to watch, but it\\'s shocking and disturbing. We then shift to find Otis Haywood Sr (Keith David) working the horses on a ranch with his son, OJ Jr (Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya, JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH, 2021). Dad founded the Haywood Hollywood Ranch to train and handle horses for the entertainment industry - movies, TV shows, advertisements. A mysterious death means OJ Jr and his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer, AKEELAH AND THE BEE, 2006) must take over running the ranch; however, a hilarious scene on set highlights the differences between big brother and little sister. OJ understands horses, but is laconic and reserved. Emerald is hungry for personal fame and is bursting with energy and dreams. She has little use for the ranch, while OJ is devoted to carrying on dad\\'s work - knowing he needs Emerald\\'s personality.The suspense is turned up to 11 when strange things begin happening on the ranch and in the sky. OJ (his name is a running gag) and Emerald recognize this is their opportunity to cash in by securing photographic evidence of UFO (or UAP) and alien activity. Joining in on the mission is Angel (a terrific Brandon Perea), a tech nerd from Fry\\'s Electronics. The trio is joined later by renowned cinematographer Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott using a Tom Waits voice), who understands the importance of capturing what OJ and Emerald call \"the Oprah shot\". Obviously, this is Peele\\'s commentary on how folks today long for their chance to shine in the spotlight - and capitalize monetarily on the moment. Also recognizing this shot at fame is Ricky \"Jupe\" Park (Steven Yeun), the owner of a local western-themed amusement park. Jupe is a former child actor whose career included \"Kid Sheriff\" and a role in the sitcom featured in the opening sequence with Gordy the chimp. He has tapped into the skyward activities, but longs for more.Purposefully vague is my approach in writing about this, as director Peele and cinematographer extraordinaire, Hoyte Van Hoytema (frequent collaborator with Christopher Nolan) serve up some incredible visuals and high-suspense sequences, and it\\'s best if you know as little as possible going in. It\\'s easy to spot influences of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), \"The Twilight Zone\", and other Sci-Fi classics, as well as directors Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock. In a tip of the cap to film history, Peele ties in the early moving picture work of Eadweard Muybridge and his 1878 clip, \"The Horse in Motion.\" It\\'s a brilliant touch that cinephiles will appreciate.Supporting work comes from Donna Mills, Oz Perkins, Eddie Jemison, and Terry Notary as Gordy the Chimp, but it\\'s the chemistry between Kaluuya and Palmer that make a relatively thin story succeed as commentary on society. Peele even gets in a few pot shots at the media (TMZ) and the oversaturation of celebrity. The desolate setting of the hills and valleys outside of Los Angeles make for a perfect setting, as does the contrasting use of daytime and nighttime for certain shots. Peele proves yet again that he has a real feel for serving up commentary disguised as tension, or is it tension doused with commentary? Either way, I\\'m lining up now for his next film, whatever that may be.Opening in theaters July 22, 2022.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'LIKES:The Comedy At Times: Peele knows how to put comedy into his work and often to maximize the laughs. He does this very well again, using so little to accomplish so much without trying. His skits with Keele showed putting a lot of energy, but for Nope, the comedy is much more controlled, dropped in at the right times to try and offset the tension. Peele manages to put a lot of fun into the writing from the blunt delivery of Kaluuya\\'s lines to the energetic come get some of Palmer\\'s character Em, it just comes off natural and is not too wedged in to get in the way of the movie. It\\'s also sprinkled nicely throughout the movie, and finding the right time to spice up the moment.The Pace Mostly: For a movie that promised to be elevated horror and potentially very deep, the pacing was decent for this writer. Nope starts out the same style of Peele\\'s work, taking lots of time set up the pieces and give you inklings of how everyone will be connected. Then as the events start to happen, he manages to ramp things up and start focusing on uncovering elements, all while still focusing on that character development. It\\'s the intrigue that pulled me in, trying to see what the next the level to the story was all while trying to discover the twist he had in store. The pace continued to be like that for much of the film, until right about the end where things changed, but for about 75% of the movie, the pace was thrilling for this horror movie.The Twist: Peele has always found a way to put his shocking imagination to the works and really keep you guessing as to what the spin to the story will be. Once again, he does not fail to deliver, bringing with it elevated levels of viewing the world and clever symbolism to show the state of the world. His use famous verses and quotes, mixed with subtle signs and visual aids, all work to be that level of poetic disposition he does so well, allowing one to interpret the message to their liking. And yet, for those who just want straight gimmicks and entertainment, Peele is there to give you an odd change to formula that may or may not be impressive to you. For me, he again uses it well and gives the science fiction genre a nice refresh that has plenty to offer the horror element, some shots he used very well to display it. That thrill part really makes the story take a new element and the way he integrates in the odd manner at the end.The Horror Elements/Tension: Now we are getting to the stuff most care about for the genre, and in this film the horror elements are certainly creative and well done at times. Nope works on several levels to give you the chills experience, starting with the odd and offset, where just enough hints are given to bait you, but have not given everything away. They then start adding tension to the mix, using elements to build up the moment with use of shadows, the feeling of abandonment and the use of shadows. Soon, crazy things start getting immersed into the movie, and the sickening elements bleed in, nods to the classic horror movies, as the disturbing visuals get their moment creep you out. Finally, the tension at the end as the whole finale hits, gives you that intensity to help maintain the edge, but drops the horror element for something else. Again, there is a wicked nature to the whole thing that darker beings will love to watch.The Acting: You\\'ve heard it from many, but no surprise, Nope has an A game of cast to bring this movie to life. Once more, all the cast hits their shining moment and brings that intricacy that the film needs to make sure it comes off creepy. For the big three though we have a few more words to say. Perea is the guy who is the blend of both characters, the sort of comedic support a film needs to help offset the horror. He\\'s a fun character to dive into and certainly makes for an entertaining lead with plenty of jokes to throw into the fire. However, the two leads are the brother and sister duo of OJ and Em, and the group who portray them. Palmer is energetic, bringing sass and fire that is trying to bring the ranch to modern times and challenge the threat at hand. She\\'s the visionary of the group, and her energy livens up the rather serious tone without shattering the believability or elements of the story. It really works and she executes it so well that you can\\'t help but get pulled into all the traits she brings. As for Kaluuya, he transitions well into the modern cowboy roles and I was very impressed with how much he was able to do with so few words spoken. There is just something in his performance and mannerisms that works so well, and I was very happy to see how Peele used his talents to really make the simplistic character layered in comedy, story, and just plain laughs.The Cinematography: By far, my favorite was the cinematography and the sound that went with it. Nope is all about the right shot to get the moment perfectly terrifying and Peele\\'s team did it beautifully in bringing the odd encounter to life. Shadows as mentioned earlier are deceptive and haunting, leaving you feeling isolated, but yet watched. The angles of the saucer attack grip you into the experience and find a way to make the whole ordeal as gruesome and terrifying as you expect. Even the emotional moments has all the right direction to them and I felt the presence of every moment in the presentation they brought us. Thrown in great sound elements to back it up, or lack of it some cases, and Nope\\'s technical aspect achieves great thing for this reviewer to make it worthwhile to visit in theaters.DISLIKES:Plot Holes/Underused Elements: I agree with other reviewers that Peele\\'s plot seemed a little less put together as some of his other works. Nope holds a lot of elements to it, but in terms of complete character story, full on challenges, and even answers to some brimming questions the movie does not quite wrap things up as neatly as he does. The random film element tie in for one character is certainly interesting, but is this awkward tangent that is more a symbolic poke at something and could have been left out. A legendary camera man seems to have a lot prowess and logic, but then things happen to counter that, subtle hints being seen that don\\'t quite make sense and seem a bit hurried. Even Angel\\'s background is sort of like a stoner secondary character that would have been nice to flesh out. All in all, these elements are present enough to get you thinking and serve as the sword slash to modern day culture, but don\\'t quite fit as nicely together like other parts of his movies.Cross the Line a Little On One my elements: I can\\'t really say much without ruining a twist, but there is a bit of animal cruelty in this movie that is not my particular taste. As human as many productions are, there are some portrayals that I\\'m just not a fan of watching and Peele sometimes cross the line for me. I have to give him props for keeping it relevant, but there were other moments I would have preferred not to see.A Few Random Elements That Seemed Jammed In: This has to do with the ending where a lot of things happen very quickly in the climactic finale. Particularly the introduction of a random character whose name holds the symbolic nature, the smoothness of the final moment is mediocre for this reviewer. These elements may have held more shine in the poke fun at modern times role, however story wise seemed out of place and less useful than just adding more to the other characters we were already invested in. Sure, Peele does have some set up to help out and throw real world logic into it, but it just did not seem useful given what was about to happen.The Pacing: As mentioned, the pace is definitely interesting for about 70-75% of the film, but that other part is a little up and down for me. Watching it unfold at times, the movie drags a bit, going down this element that is supposed to mean something big, but again barely fits into the ordeal they are crafting. Meanwhile, the ending seems very rushed, with things happening that just don\\'t make sense nor have the tie ups I like to see in his work. There are \"changes\" that happen to the characters, but they are so sudden with only tidbits of dialogue to support them that you wonder a bit more why they did what they did. Watching breakdowns from the artistic point works, but as for story elements it\\'s a bit disappointing for the average viewer.The Verdict:Nope is a movie with an interesting name, and like most of Peele\\'s work an interesting premise for both artistic sakes and horror sakes. He finds a way to merge the three worlds of mystery, horror, and sci-fi into this layered film, that is pretentious, but still holds entertaining elements that we like to see. Great acting, a deep story, horror elements that take advantage of so many things, alongside supreme visuals are the keys to what makes this movie hold a lot of bite. It\\'s weird, it\\'s convoluted, and yet it works if you can get onboard with his trippy thriller work from the past. However, the movie is not my favorite of the bunch and does not quite get the smoothness that I\\'ve seen in the past of this film. It\\'s rushed at times, boring at others, with a story element running tangent that does not quite mesh as well as other origin elements of previous works. Still, it\\'s a fun movie with a few moments worth rewatching, and for those enjoying symbolic takes of the times, worth even more views to dissect all Peele has crammed into the film. Definitely worth a trip to the movies for this one, and I encourage you to take a moment and view it where you can.My scores are:Horror/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 8.0\\nMovie Overall: 7.0.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'The way most critics are raving about \"Nope\" makes me wonder if I\\'ve been the victim of an elaborate prank where I was shown a different film than what they have been watching.Because \"Nope\" is, at best, adequate -- a watchable sci-fi action picture that, if it weren\\'t for the fact that it\\'s directed by an Oscar-winning red-hot director and has a budget of roughly $60 mil and stars an Oscar-winning actor, would not be out of place among the myriad of B-movies that litter the virtual shelves of Netflix or Prime Video.First, the good stuff: the film looks gorgeous. Lots of beautiful shots of cloudy skies and spectacular night and day vistas. It was shot on Imax cameras by a master (Hoyte Van Hoytema, Christopher Nolan\\'s regular cinematographer), and it shows. And the dark, foreboding imagery helps Jordan Peele build some effective tension during the first half of the film, when the audience (and the film\\'s characters) still don\\'t know exactly what\\'s going on and what exactly is threatening them.But then the film devolves into a mess where everyone (including the main antagonist) behaves illogically because that\\'s what the plot requires them to do in order to hit all the subtextual marks that Jordan Peele wants them to deliver. And therein lies the biggest problem with the film: it\\'s a very unsubtle \\'message\\' movie, and Jordan Peele, really wants you to get what he\\'s trying to say, to the point of driving the point home with a hammer, over and over.Without going into spoiler territory, the film\\'s plot is a not-so-veiled metaphor for the state of entertainment in our society. All the characters have some sort of connection to the entertainment industry in some form and/or are meant to symbolize a facet of it: the protagonists are two African American siblings, one of whom runs the family business, a ranch providing horses for Hollywood movies; the other is a wannabe performer/entertainer.Their business is dying: animals are being supplanted by CGI, and horses can be unpredictable on set and hard to control, and therefore replaceable. Any parallel with the perception of people of color in the same industry is of course not accidental. Then you have the kid who works at (now defunct) Fry\\'s Electronics and is all about digital videos and streaming content. His name is Angel, probably because calling him YouTube or TikTok would have been a tad too transparent. Then there\\'s the the grizzled, obsessed old filmmaker (played by Michael Wincott, your go-to guy when you want someone who looks gruff and curmudgeonly, down to the \\'I just swallowed drain cleaner\\' hoarse voice) who is disillusioned with the drivel he\\'s forced to shoot nowadays and is ready to roll with his trusty hand-cranked non-digital film camera and to sacrifice everything to the altar of cinematic art.We also have the Asian cowboy slash circus entertainer (Steven Yeun) who suffered a traumatic event as a child actor which left him with deep unhealed psychological scars simmering under the surface, which all stereotypical ex-child actors are supposed to have and which of course will lead him to make horribly wrong, life-changing decisions. And, in what is the most transparent cypher in film packed to the gills with them, you have a TMZ reporter that is not even given a name or a face: he just shows up at some point on an electric motorcycle wearing a reflective helmet (get it? He\\'s just mirroring society\\'s obsession with capturing celebrities\\' life! Hoo boy!) and expensive cameras. And of course we all know how Hollywood feels about paparazzi, so if you can\\'t guess what\\'s going to happen to him, you will love this film unironically.Nobody in the film behaves the way a regular human being would. They do things because Jordan Peele needs them to deliver a message to the audience, logic and common sense be damned. I\\'m not even sure the film takes place in the real world, since all the events seem to involve only this microcosm of characters and nobody else. It\\'s like a Beckett play, except that the stage is a vast valley in the California desert inhabited only by a handful of people and the outside world doesn\\'t exist and is somehow unaware of the very visible and bizarre events taking place.Imagine if Jaws took place in the California desert and the shark had a message against Hollywood and showbiz consumerism painted in bright neon letters on its side, and Brody, Quint and Hooper were replaced by much less competent characters whose purpose is not to kill the man-eating menace but to take pictures of it so they can sell it to Oprah and become rich, and you\\'ll have a pretty good idea of the basic plot of \"Nope\" (and the Jaws comparisons don\\'t end there -- you\\'ll see what I mean at the end of the film).As a scary movie, Nope is pretty devoid of actual scares (Peele has to resort to the oldest trick in the book, the \\'jump scare\\', in a couple of occasions). It\\'s also surprising tame in the blood and gore department (most of the carnage takes place offscreen).The talented cast does what they can with the material. Daniel Kaluuya\\'s OJ is nicely understated: a no-nonsense guy who seems to react to most of the craziness around him with a shrug or by saying \"nope\" (of course). Kiki Palmer is fine as his sister, though in typically cliched fashion, she suddenly switches from \"shrieking, terrified woman\" to \"resourceful heroine\" when the plot demands it. But they can\\'t save the film because they have to go through the motions of a plot that becomes increasingly preposterous (the plan that they devise in the third act makes no sense the more you think about it)\\nNope continues the downward trajectory of Jordan Peele after Get Out and Us. The former, still a modern masterpiece, succeeded because the metaphorical subtext didn\\'t get in the way of the plot: even if you completely ignored the clear references to slavery and race relationships, it still worked perfectly as a basic thriller.Us was where we started getting hints Peele\\'s ambition might exceed his grasp (it was deliciously creepy and well executed, but the basic concept of a race of \"alternate\" underground dwelling doppelgangers was too bonkers and forced to work)\\nAnd now we have Nope, where nothing makes sense outside of its function as a delivery system for Peele\\'s criticism of Hollywood, its treatment of minorities, and our society\\'s total dependence on entertainment at all costs.I\\'ve seen critics make favorable comparison between Jordan Peele and Steven Spielberg (mainly due to the very evident influence of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the aforementioned \"Jaws), but a more apt comparison would be with M. Night Shyamalan, another director who hit the jackpot early in his career with a terrific movie and then proceeded to squander his potential with increasingly ambitious and less effective muddled message films.In many ways, Nope is Jordan Peele\\'s \"Signs\". Still enjoyable in parts, but too self-conscious for its own good and a far cry from the promise shown with Get Out.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Jordan Peele\\'s return to the big screen is a tremendous, refreshing change of pace to the recent Hollywood flops and disappointments the recent MCU films have been.Jordan Peele is in top form with his recent film Nope. I am very pleasantly surprised with how well done this was and how much I enjoyed this film. I had no doubt with Jordan Peele he would do something good but he has set a new bar in the psychological, thriller, horror genre.I don\\'t know where to start as I have so many thoughts racing through my brain, so I\\'ll start simple. Great cinematography this film was beautiful and looked great on the IMAX screen. Great writing and I have to stop to say the writing in this film is superior to the writing in Get Out and Us. Jordan Peele\\'s writing talent has come a long way since those films. The dialogue and chemistry between actors and characters was so organic, it just felt so natural and nothing feeling forced. Speaking of things not feeling forced the comedy and jokes, all do so well and don\\'t detract from the serious tone of the film.Which will lead me to great acting. Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea, and Steven Yeun (just to name a few of the films stars) all give tremendous performances. It was so great to see Steven Yeun as I haven\\'t seen him in anything since he starred as Glenn Rhee in The Walking Dead. Amazing sound design and sound effects, it truly brought the tension and horror to tremendous heights it had me on the edge of my sit.Now I want to discuss the viewing experience as it has been a long time since a horror film truly had an impact on me. Some genuinely terrifying moments that like I said had me on the edge of my seat. I am not easily scared and jump scares I find them to be cheap and weak but there were some scares here that genuinely made me jump. At one moment I found myself saying \"nope, not today Satan\" I\\'m sure there will be a lot of \"nope\" remarks from audience members. But is this worth the IMAX screen? To that question I\\'d say yes and no. This film did not make much use of IMAX cameras which throughout the film made me question why is it in IMAX? But I have to say when the IMAX sequences finally came along it was great. The utilization of the IMAX cameras in certain scenes made for a great pay off and of course coupled with the great IMAX sound it heightened the viewing experience. But I can\\'t say it was a must watch in IMAX. To steer away from spoilers I will simply say a teaser trailer for a certain upcoming film from my favorite director made watching it in IMAX well worth it.I\\'ll start wrapping this up as I\\'m sure some people who saw the amount of text in this review thought \"nope, I\\'m not reading all that\" no pun intended. The only real downside of this film for me was it did lose a little steam in the conclusion and I didn\\'t feel satisfied nor unsatisfied. I still have a lot of questions and would like some more information but perhaps these questions are answered in the film and I missed them. I definitely plan on multiple viewings of this film.This is my new favorite Jordan Peele film, better than his recent film Us and right up there with Get Out while surpassing it. I would rate this film between a 8.5 or 8.9 but because I don\\'t like half scores I\\'m going to give it the full 9 because of how this film at moments genuinely had me jumping. It was a fun, exciting, thrill ride from start to finish. I look forward to whatever comes next from Jordan Peele.IMDb: 9/10\\nLetterboxd: 4/5Watched in IMAX Theater.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Nope (2022) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a family horse business that is slipping through the children's fingers after their father passed away due to a lack of securing new revenue streams. When they see a spaceship on their land they think this is their next big meal ticket...until they discover what they thought was a spaceship might not be a spaceship after all...This movie is directed by Jordan Peele (Get Out) and stars Daniel Kaluuya (Judas and the Black Messiah), Keke Palmer (Hustlers), Steven Yeun (Walking Dead), Brandon Perea (Doom Patrol) and Michael Wincott (Alien: Resurrection).This is a magnificent entry into the science fiction genre by Jordan Peele. The characters and storyline have tremendous depth and several clever sub plots. The sitcom sub plot with the monkey was absolutely outstanding. The characters are fascinating and Kaluuya kills the mannerisms, self doubt and ability to stay cool while screaming inside. The cinematography was breathtaking and the CGI, which is leveraged more than any other Peele picture, was perfection. The menace in this is very clever and felt like a mix of Deep Rising and Cloverfield. My one complaint is I liked the ending but I didn't love it.Overall this is a brilliant release into the science fiction genre that I would score an 8-8.5/10 and strongly recommend.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'An alien presence above a ranch threatens the lives of those below.Plot holes galore add up to sink this film about two-thirds of the way through. Like so many other people, I came to this Jordan Peele film wanting to like it, but just couldn\\'t find enough redeeming factors. The film opens with objects such as keys and coins raining down from the sky, causing at least one fatality. Why did this happen? We are told the official reason was \"probably an airplane.\" What, the authorities weren\\'t interested? No proper investigation was ever carried out?From this sloppy beginning we learn later that the Steven Yeun character knows what he is dealing with, and thinks he controls it, in order to cash in. And he cashes in by.... staging a nightly show to a dozen customers. The man has literally made contact with extra-terrestrial life, and this is all he can come up with to monetize his breakthrough? Any remaining shred of plausibility for this storyworld is lost in this moment.There are a few laughs, Daniel Kaluuya is a brooding and engaging presence, but that is scant reward for the ticket price. The sister is loud and annoying. The alien is super clever, then super dumb. It all fails to cohere around any credible narrative spine. Everyone turned up, but they forgot to write the damn movie.'},\n",

I still prefer Peele\\'s first film \"Get Out\", and I haven\\'t seen \"Us\" but I\\'m probably gonna check it out now.I also see a lot of it as a smart twist on the horror genre. Whereas a lot of filmmakers create horror movies where the main characters survive despite their stupidity, this one plays on the main characters actually being clever enough to \"nope out.\" Finally, our years of yelling \"don\\'t go in the closet/basement/outside, you idiot!\" at the movie screen have been answered.Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya are terrific as the stars. The cinematography is on point. This whole movie is beautifully shot with a lot of subplots and recurring themes that will leave a lot of room for interpretation and after-movie discussion.Definitely one of the best of 2022 so far.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I went into this film with an open mind, because frankly I\\'ve liked one movie Jordan Peele has done, and wasn\\'t expecting a good story. What I got from \\'Nope\\' was that there\\'s a broader story to tell here. Beginning with the TV series featuring a chimpanzee named Gordy and the 6 minute \"incident\" caught on camera. I wasn\\'t sure why it was a focal point to begin with, other than the film itself discusses animal behavior, specifically territoriality. Peele takes liberty with history and facts that might persuade viewers that information about the \\'Animal Locomotion\\' film or the Haywood family are true. The small amusement park called Jupiter\\'s Claim had their own invitational title cared at the end of the movie. Even the in-film television series titled Gordy seems as if it could have been an actual show. Some of the fiction was mixed with non-fiction such as relating the Haywood family with the film work on \\'The Scorpion King\\'. There was also a bit of information about renaming UFOs, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena) that is based on fact. If all of these connections came from actual events I would have granted \\'Nope\\' 10 stars, because it was pieced together so well.Ultimately the movie is about a UFO. It centers the story, but ultimately this is a character driven film. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer are masterful actors. I would love to see Keke Palmer\\'s character Emerald Haywood turn up in more stories. I\\'d have to say she carried the film. Daniel Kaluuya\\'s character OJ Haywood was rather quiet and calm throughout the plot, as his sister Emerald over shadowed him in public speaking and representation. I really enjoyed his mannerisms because he genuinely complemented the sister and balanced them as a family dynamic. They behave just like most brothers & sisters I\\'ve known. I was sad to see Keith David as their father not get a larger slot in the movie. I\\'ve always liked Keith David, and his performance as Otis Haywood Sr. While small was incredibly good. He\\'s such a great actor and I would have liked that the audience see more of him in comparison to the roles he\\'s more famous for.The story was hindered by the editing. It broke off in chapters to tell more of the background of the character Ricky \"Jupe\" Park played by Steven Yeun. It was as if the director sought to reuse the character in a separate feature, and utilizes \\'Nope\\' to present that origin story. It\\'s a rather minor role that was underwhelming for the full story. There were hints at a larger story for the Haywood family, with older events presented that simply were not given enough life within this setting. I would like to see more of these same characters because they were the best thing about the movie. I would also have rated this movie higher if it was an era piece, perhaps set in the 1950\\'s. The overall feel was available, it had the ambiance of a western about it, but Peele modernized it with camera equipment, vehicles, and an electric motorcycle. Admittedly if the electric motorcycle was removed from the final result, then \\'Nope\\' would have become timeless and lasting for several years to come.In regards to viewer response, I think most people will enjoy \\'Nope\\'. It\\'s really good when Peele stays on the characters, and the ending was amazing towards the finale. I just wish there was more of what got held back for the climax. It\\'s definitely worth watching and it\\'ll remain a valuable addition to science fiction. Nice job, Jordan.'},\n",

He\\'s always at the top of his game, though in this absurd waste of time and energy, he did the best he could with what he had to work with. You can see and feel his emotions through his facial expressions and his eyes, and he really doesn\\'t need to have a line of dialogue. That\\'s talent and he was actually the best thing in this film.Keke Palmer was over the top in \"Nope\", to the point of where she was sometimes wildly annoying. Palmer needed to tamp it down in a lot of scenes. She was doing WAY too much.Allow me to say that I am firmly on team Jordan Peele. I loved \"Get Out\", I liked a lot of \"Us\" (you can never go wrong with Lupita Nyong\\'o and Winston Duke), but \"Nope\" is by far the worst film of the three Peele horror films. As a matter of fact, it\\'s a bad film period. I know a lot of people want to get into an esoteric conversation regarding the symbolism in \"Nope\", save it, that\\'s people attempting to see what\\'s not really there, and to rescue and make excuses for a horribly ill-conceived film.The pacing was slow as HELL, the storylines, and there were many, were unnecessarily complicated and confusing.

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"Nope,\" is one of the most anticipated releases of the summer, with its cryptic trailer promising another genre-bending, politically charged thriller from Peele, albeit one that includes UFOs. The film, which stars Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as a brother and sister who run Hollywood\\'s only Black-owned horse ranch, has prompted plenty of speculation from cinephiles about its UFO plotlines. It\\'s surprising how little information about writer/director Jordan Peele\\'s \"Nope\" has leaked since it was first announced. There have been a few trailers that show what may or may not be the film\\'s primary threat, and the marketing team has done a very good job with posters of its main cast members looking up at the sky and uttering the film\\'s title. All that thirst for capitalistic box office gain comes with a price, namely that it builds hype and an audience expectation that may not be met once the finished product is unveiled. After the massively entertaining, Oscar-winning calling card of \"Get Out,\" Jordan Peele moved toward a hybrid of audience pleaser and filmmaker\\'s jones with \"Us.\" That film was less blatant and required more work on the audience\\'s part, which made it fascinating for some and frustrating for others. It was also powered by a career-best performance by Lupita Nyong\\'o, whose dual role was unshakably strange and multilayered. There is no equivalent performance in \"Nope\" to anchor viewers, and it\\'s about three times as messy. The rest of the cast features Steven Yuen as Jupe, a barker who runs an alien-based carnival of sorts out in the same middle of nowhere the Haywoods have their ranch, and Angel (Brandon Perea), a techie specializing in surveillance equipment he sells out of a Best Buy clone called \"Ray\\'s.\" \"Nope\" is not as good as \"Get Out\" or \"Us,\" but it\\'s definitely Peele\\'s creepiest movie. He\\'s always been more Rod Serling than Rob Zombie, and that\\'s most evident here. There\\'s humor to be had in the minority characters\\' reactions to horror (yes, they say \"nope\" the way most people would say \"oh HELL NAW!\"), but the director really leans into Hitchcock\\'s tenet about suspense vs. Surprise. The wait for something awful to happen is always worse than when it does. Peele also gets good performances out of Kaluuya and Palmer, who believably work the sibling angle with all its longstanding grudges, in-jokes and patterns based on who\\'s older. Wincott wields his wonderful voice as a force of nature. Yuen seems to be off-kilter and the movie\\'s weak link, but the more I thought about his plotline, the more his performance made sense. I think he\\'s the film\\'s biggest breadcrumb in terms of figuring it all out. As for the special effects, they\\'re interesting, to say the least.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'We liked it, rating it a 7.5. I\\'ve read many of the poor reviews, and...I don\\'t get it. \"Horror\" doesn\\'t mean only gory, bloody, slasher films. Suspense is integral to a horror film, and Nope delivers that. No story line? There\\'s something strange going on in their gulch that killed their dad, they\\'re trying to find out what it is - and capitalize on it. Not that hard.SPOILERS\"aliens abducting people and animals for some reason\" REALLY? Alien was EATING them! How hard is that to figure out?\"And where did the flying shrapnel even come from?\" SERIOUSLY? The alien was ridding its digestive system of anything inorganic. How hard is that to figure out?\"a crazed A/V specialist who sacrifices himself for no reason\" REALLY? I guess most people \"watch\" movies but really don\\'t pay attention. Antlers made some statement about his being the best, and how hard it is to top that. When he saw the creature, he knew his greatest achievement would be to get the perfect shot - of being swallowed up into it. Like storm chasers who would love to film being picked up by a tornado. He knew he could film the innards, and then the alien would spit out the camera and film - thus giving the world a film clip that no one else could ever top.\"slow moving\" and \"boring\". I\\'m guessing these are people who have the attention span of a gnat and want something to happen every five seconds. \"Slow moving\" - it\\'s actually building suspense. Nothing boring about it. Every scene had a purpose.* e.g. Why did Jupe want to buy the ranch? For the sacrificial horses he used every Friday night...(Which is dumb. It\\'d be far cheaper to buy horses destined for slaughter.)*We had a hard time figuring out the \"why\" of the Gordy subplot. When I Googled it, now I get the tie-in. Google \"what\\'s the deal with Gordy the chimp in nope\" to get the Mashable article, which explains it well.We thought the film was beautifully shot, that the pacing was good, we understood the characters (introverted OJ, fame-seeking Emerald), and the plan to capture the alien on film based on everything they\\'d observed about it - and not die - was fun.My only issues with it were:\\n#1 - I didn\\'t get the whole Gordy subplot before I Googled it.#2 - I thought it stupid that it wouldn\\'t suck you up if you didn\\'t look at it. I\\'d missed the point about it \"being territorial\" so don\\'t challenge it by looking at it. I\\'m sorry, but in my mind, an alien with that technology can tell what\\'s organic or not. Organic? Suck up and eat. Not organic? Pass.#3 - I was disappointed the alien opened up to the big floaty thing. The concept of it being a hard spaceship on the outside, organic on the inside (like Battlestar Galactica\\'s Cylon Raiders) was much more interesting to me. And blowing up just because it ate one giant balloon...aargh.But we liked it. It was intriguing, it was fun.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"* First off, I want to commend Peele for giving the movie heaping spoonfuls of atmosphere. From the opening chatter of the sitcom turning into unknown shrieks and a chimp with blood-dripping lips, you feel the unease. In fact, every scene with Gordy is terrifying and unsettling, shot to perfection with slow tracking and set shots. It's not completely without rhyme or reason (combined with the grasshopper, but I'll get to that in a minute), but it's just out of left field enough to really jar you.Then there's the cinematography. Jordan Peele once again takes his time with the shots, establishing location and atmosphere as things not peripheral, but essential to the movie. Often the camera will pan when most directors would choose a cut. The result? Scenes that are allowed to breathe and really stick in one's mind. There are several scenes that I think will stick with me for years, including the house of blood, Gordy, and a great Signs-esque fakeout in the barn. Even the red herrings are given time. The landscapes and night scenes are beautifully shot.Next, characterization is good. While Daniel Kaluuya plays rather a stoic role as OJ, Keke Palmer steals the show as his sister, Emerald. Right from the get-go you feel her vivacious, carefree vibe, and the movie takes time to show quirks like her randomly complimenting a stranger and impulsively tossing a sour patch kids candy in the shopping cart.Then there's the sci-fi references that Peele makes in the movie. (Honestly, he said he was inspired by a handful of movies, so I had my eyes peeled. Get it?) The security camera scene is faintly reminiscent of the baby monitor scene in Signs, the twister sucking up people is referencing Wizard of Oz (in addition to an overt reference about ruby slippers on the cell phone), and perhaps the most obvious one, a Jurassic Park rainstorm reference during the thunderstorm alien attack (except it's where the horse go?) One more film that I don't think Peele mentioned referencing but came to mind is Hitchcock's The Birds-the fear of animals turning on humans for no apparent reason. In this movie, the grasshopper blocking the security camera seems to be doing it on purpose, blocking it at the alien's bidding. Gordy goes crazy and eats people, probably prodded by the alien as well. The motif of predators and the food chain is prevalent in the film, and the humans are no longer on top.Okay, now for the criticism. Major spoilers ahead. At the beginning of what I consider the third act, the UFO is revealed to be an alien entity itself. This slows the momentum and tension of the movie for two reasons-there is no mystery anymore of what the thing is, and there is no possibility of a further reveal of smaller aliens, where they could hide and provide further scares and tension. Once the reveal is made, it becomes no longer a horror movie so much as it becomes a cat and mouse, chase film. The audience is no longer left guessing, and can focus on the one big creature in the sky. It's not that it kills the movie, just slows it down and decreases the increasing suspense and dread in the film. The more the UFO is shown, the less it becomes a spectacle and the more it becomes a bore. Then there's the ambiguous themes in the film. I already mentioned that there's a food chain motif, and I'm sure there are more that would be found with repeat viewings, but immediately I can't think of the overarching theme that ties the film together. Whereas with Get Out and Us the theme and focus of the movie was clear, with Nope Peele seems to put a lot on the plate without committing to any of them. I concede this could change with more viewings, however.Anywho, I enjoyed the movie, especially the first two-thirds. Oh yeah, and the soundtrack rocks. There's a few needle drops, and music is used to good effect in the film. I'll probably watch it again and try to figure it out a little more, but dang, I wish either the twist was held for longer or not made at all.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I\\'ve been dragging my feet on typing out my thoughts on Nope for almost a month because it has me completely puzzled. Frankly, the film has aged like milk in my mind. After initially thinking it was a pretty good film when I came home from the theater, time has passed and I have begun to question what I was even thinking. I\\'ll at least give it credit for being more compelling than Us because it didn\\'t get so bogged down in trying to create an allegory that the story of the film was lost. However, it is light years away from the genius of Get Out and has me wondering if Jordan Peele was a one-hit wonder. Most of the rest of this review will be considered spoilers, so if you don\\'t know anything about the plot of this movie and don\\'t want to know, then stop reading here.The best part of Nope was the unique design of the alien, and how it takes on multiple forms depending on the situation. I greatly appreciated that they didn\\'t go with the same old designs that we\\'ve all seen a hundred times before. I also have to give some credit to the originality of this idea, focusing an entire movie on animal training. I like some of the history we are given of the practice and how they work closely with the horses in order to create the perfect conditions so that the animals will do what the director wants them to do. But the idea that the techniques he uses for horses will have a direct correlation to what is needed for an alien is about as plausible as Jeff Goldblum giving an alien ship a computer virus with a laptop in the 1990s.I had some massive struggles with the erratic behavior of the alien in Nope, because it implies the thing is unpredictable, yet they seem to figure out everything they need to do in order to get the \"Oprah shot.\" Speaking of which, it bothered me tremendously that they made such a big thing about Keke Palmer\\'s character getting the picture at the end when they already had an entire roll of film to use as evidence (which will be far more compelling than a still shot.) It\\'s just shoddy writing and one of many things that seem to happen in the film for no other reason than the movie needed it to happen. But the single most damning thing I can say about Nope is that a minor subplot we only see through flashbacks is far more interesting than anything that happens with the alien. I shouldn\\'t be wishing I could go back and learn more about that one moment in the past when I\\'m seeing everything play out in the present. I can\\'t say Nope is bad, it\\'s just underwhelming, which is a shame.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Perhaps this film was geared toward a certain audience. Perhaps that audience got all the supposed symbolism and in-references and Easter eggs, and god-knows-what. For this audience member, all I got was \"Huh?\"For reasons that remain unclear, a deadly cloud hovers over a certain part of the \"inland empire\" in California. Inside the deadly cloud is some kind of \"UFO\" that apparently likes to vacuum up people and spit out whatever it doesn\\'t like (which, I guess, are metallic objects or other \"inedibles\"). A brother and sister (Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer), who are also part of a horse training family, and who live in said empire, start to realize that something is terribly wrong. The sister decides that if they can really get a clear shot or video of the UFO, they can sell it and make lots of money. The fact that her and her brother\\'s lives may also be in danger doesn\\'t seem to occur to her. They bring into their fold a \"tech expert\" (Brandon Perea) and a cinematographer (Michael Wincott) in apparent hopes of doing things the right way and guaranteeing that they can capture the \"Oprah\" shot.This is one story that is put forth. Another story that is put forth is that of former child actor \"Jupe\" (Steven Yuen) who was part of a show that had a live animal (a chimpanzee) that apparently goes insane and single-handedly destroys the set of a sitcom that was being filmed in front of a live audience, not to mention mauling one of the actresses (this is done off-screen).Jupe grows up to run some kind of weird amusement park where, I guess, he sacrifices animals to this cloud/UFO. I say \"guess\" because I really didn\\'t know what was going on.These two stories exist side by side, simultaneously, and in tandem with each other. Neither makes sense.The \"cloud/UFO\" apparently only comes out during the day. Why that is, I don\\'t know. Also, the \"cloud/UFO\" apparently is only interested in people/animals from the inland empire. Why? Again, I have no idea.There is not really one likable character in this film, except perhaps the \"tech expert,\" who seems to be the most grounded, and actually seems to have a conscience. Otherwise, you won\\'t care about anyone, and as such, you won\\'t be invested in this bizarre, Twilight-Zone-esque movie that really doesn\\'t go anywhere.While Daniel Kaluuya was extremely watchable in \"Get Out,\" in this film, he mumbles his way through from start to finish. I could barely understand a word he said. He also seemed deeply depressed, and when the \"cloud/UFO\" thing was hovering right above his car, the emotion on his face barely registered. And Keke Palmer spent a lot of time running in and out of a room with a computer monitor, and achieving nothing.We stayed till the end because we honestly thought something was going to happen, but, honestly, nothing does. The film was a big let-down and I do not understand the long list of awards.While there may have been a unique story in its midst, \"Nope\" doesn\\'t come close to tapping its own potential.'},\n",

One day, small things start falling out of the sky and Otis Sr., who runs the farm, is struck and killed. His kids OJ and EM try to carry on the farm... At this pint we are 10 min into the film.Couple of comments: this is the 3rd film from writer-producer-director Jordan Peele, after the brilliant \"Get Out\" and the okay but uneven \"Us\". With \"Nope\", Peele goes on a much bigger scale and along the way brings us a sci-fi mystery movie. The lesser said about the plot, the better so as not to spoil anything. Just watch! In the bigger picture. Big Hollywood has become so extremely risk adverse that if a movie isn\\'t Marvel or DC Comic-related, or otherwise a sequel or prequel or spin-off or other franchise-related property, chances are the movie won\\'t be made. In other words, big Hollywood as much as possible avoids an ORIGINAL idea, and as a result truly original amazing movies like Christopher Nolan\\'s \"Tenet\" become ever rarer. This makes \"Nope\" truly a breath of fresh air in today\\'s stale Hollywood climate. Big budget, big idea, above all, ORIGINAL. Does that make it a perfect movie? Nope, it does not. But at least Peele tries. Daniel Kaluuya as OJ is tops, yet again. Apparently there is already talk of a sequel. To which I say, NOPE! I am crossing my fingers that Peel\\'s next film will be something completely different altogether from what he has done to date, as long as it\\'s original. No sequel, please!\"Nope\" opened in theaters last weekend and I saw it here in Cincinnati just the other night. The Tuesday evening discount screening was pretty much a sell-out. If you are in the mood for an original sci-fi mystery, I\\'d readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.'},\n",

She does similar things throughout the movie, says she wants something then completely 180s on it.The asian guy was not needed at all for anything. Nor was his Gordy story arc. It provided nothing, went nowhere, and was relevant to not one single thing in the movie. Saying that, the idiocy of him deciding to reveal the alien by using it in his small rodeo show made no sense whatsoever. Also made no sense that he had seen it presumably multiple times over the previous 6 months since he knew what time to expect it at.... what he expected from the horse during his revealing scene was also unclear... was he really buying expensive show horses just to have them be f.n eaten???? Go buy some livestock cattle if that\\'s the plan, surely it would\\'ve been cheaper than $11,500 per show horse.At the end we\\'ve got sister riding off on an Ebike to the now abandoned asian neighbors, to use an old Polaroid camera.

In this case, the aliens are the 'boogie men'. It's clear they are vicious and deadly, and they're carnivorous but it doesn't go any deeper. There's no discernible rhyme or reason to what they're doing besides enjoying a few meals.They are clearly superior and can do whatever they want, whenever they want, but for some reason it takes them a painfully long time to make another move.By that time, for me, the whole thing fell apart.

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"Nope\" is a sci-fi horror film written and directed by Jordan Peele (\"Get Out\", \"Us\"). Starring Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Steven Yeun, it is a strange yet undeniably original experience from beginning to end that is sure to polarise audiences right down the middle.In California, siblings Otis \"OJ\" Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald \"Em\" Haywood (Keke Palmer) inherit their father\\'s (Keith David) ranch for media productions shortly after his untimely death. The two siblings struggle to keep the ranch in business due to their conflicting interests, with OJ hoping to continue his father\\'s legacy working on the farm while Em desires to become famous in Hollywood. One night, the electricity surrounding the ranch keeps repeatedly cutting out and the pair are soon shocked to discover that their horses have also seemingly vanished into thin air. Hoping to get to the bottom of this mystery, the siblings come up with a plan to capture video evidence of whatever is causing these bizarre disturbances, enlisting the help of local tech salesman Angel Torres (Brandon Perea) and cameraman Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott).After making his directorial debut in 2017 with \"Get Out\" and following up with \"Us\" two years later, Jordan Peele has risen above the ranks to become one of the most interesting filmmakers working in Hollywood today. His unique view of the world has helped separate him from most other directors who are merely piggybacking off the success of nostalgia and other things that are currently trending. If anything, Peele\\'s work feels like an appropriate antidote for those who are overwhelmed with the plethora of reboots, remakes, and sequels that only exist to make a quick buck for the major studios. It seems that Peele is now three for three because his third film \"Nope\" is yet another film benefitting greatly from his creativity, whether audiences like that kind of thing or not.To put it bluntly, this is not the type of film that is easily accessible to just anyone. As mentioned above, Jordan Peele is the type of filmmaker who relies primarily on his own perspective of things, with little outside influence over what kind of story he is trying to tell. Because of that, it is difficult to pitch this movie as something for a mainstream audience. There were so many moments that had a seasoned viewer like myself trying to figure out which particular story elements would be expanded upon later or were just there as a red herring to waste our time. Although I did find enjoyment in deducing what was relevant and what wasn\\'t, I cannot say I speak for everyone else. I can only imagine how much of a chore it would be for some viewers out there who simply want to watch a movie without the need to process all this information being thrown at them. That\\'s not to say the film is hard to follow, it\\'s just that there may be too much to take in at once, which will likely necessitate a second viewing.Much like in his previous two films, Peele has proven he has the most important talent a horror-themed director needs in order to be successful - the ability to create and sustain suspense. To create a suspenseful scene is one thing, but to prolong it for the correct amount of time is a skill very few directors have been able to master, and yet again Peele pulls it off with flying colours. I can\\'t help but admire how Peele manages to weave his audience along during certain scenes for an extended period of time, setting up intriguing situations where things could easily go either way. And when something eventually does happen, whether you predicted it or not, it still arrives with such a sudden impact that it actually feels earned and isn\\'t just a cheap jump scare added for the sake of it. There aren\\'t too many other filmmakers who have been able to do this, but one who definitely comes to mind is the \"Master of Suspense\" himself, Alfred Hitchcock. I find that most other horror directors are too reliant on gory violence for shock value so it is quite refreshing to see a filmmaker like Jordan Peele go against the grain and opt for a more classic approach to building up fear in his viewers. Although the film does have its fair share of violent moments, they aren\\'t intended as the main focus of what the audience should perceive as scary.In his second collaboration with Peele, Daniel Kaluuya proves he is the director\\'s good luck charm, as his performance fits the film\\'s tone perfectly. If they are able to keep things this good between them, then I forsee a working relationship between Peele and Kaluuya similar to that of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro in the near future. Kaluuya plays into OJ\\'s curiosity and pragmatism with such tenacity that you instantly want him to succeed in finding whoever is responsible for causing all of his problems. He is seen to be both a hard worker and an innovative thinker, which is what allows him to come up with all these clever ideas on how to gain photographic proof of this sustained threat.. Kaluuya also had great chemistry with Keke Palmer as OJ\\'s sister Em, whose sassy personality played off her on-screen brother\\'s more serious demeanour. Though the two don\\'t always agree on what is right for the ranch\\'s future, they share a close enough bond for them to understand that if this danger from the skies continues, each of their futures will be in jeopardy.Despite their shorter screen time, I think the supporting cast members Steven Yeun, Michael Wincott, and Brandon Perea are worth mentioning as well. Yeun in particular was interesting as Jupe, a former child star who buys a horse from the Haywood siblings, only to become involved in the same problems as them later on. Wincott was also a nice addition to the film as Antlers Holst, a famous cinematographer who agrees to help the siblings to capture on film who or what is causing this strange phenomenon. However, out of the three of them, relative newcomer Brandon Perea surprised me the most as Angel Torres, a tech savvy employee at an electronic store whose products end up playing an instrumental role in the discovery of what is going on. I won\\'t divulge too much more information about them at the risk of posting spoilers so all I will say the film would not have worked half as well if it weren\\'t for the combined efforts of these three.If you are tired of all the countless unnecessary sequels, obligatorily contracted reboots, or remakes nobody asked for, then a film like \"Nope\" should provide some relief if you crave originality. On that note, if you are put off by non-linear storytelling with some plot devices that lead nowhere, then this might not be your cup of tea. This isn\\'t a film that caters towards everybody\\'s tastes so I can\\'t simply recommend it to just any person. To be fair though, Peele\\'s previous two films elicited a similar response from me as well, which I suppose is a good thing the more I think about it. Any form of art that can provoke such a divided response from audiences has clearly done something right, so for that reason alone I believe the film is a success.I rate it 8/10.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'In the extensive realm of SciFi-Horror, \"Nope\" breathed a sliver of originality that felt at once captivating, intriguing, immersive, and terrifying.Jordan Peele\\'s direction and screenplay was nothing short of excellent. He gave the script an admirable Goldilocks-style \\'just right\\' balance.Michael Abels\\'s musical scoring was outstanding. Hoyte Van Hoytema\\'s cinematography was stellar. Nicholas Monsour\\'s editing was praiseworthy. Ruth De Jong\\'s production design was great. Gene Serdena\\'s set decoration and Samantha Englender\\'s art direction were also great. Alex Bovaird\\'s costume design was notable. The sound effects and VFX teams did exceptional work. The stunts and hair-makeup crews were amazing.OJ Haywood, played by Daniel Kaluuya, was unforgettable. Where some artists might have played within the lines, Kaluuya gave a deep performance - minimal yet impactful - that stretched the scope of his character.Emerald Haywood, played by Keke Palmer, was quite good. Angel Torres, played by Brandon Perea, was noteworthy. Ricky \"Jupe\" Park, played by Steven Yeun, was great. Antlers Holst, played by Michael Wincott, was amazing. Keith David gave a memorable cameo as Otis Haywood Sr.All other cast and crew did great work in \"Nope\", now streaming via Amazon Prime VOD.I lost what little sleep I had after starting this movie. Not only because it was scary - it certainly was - but also because I simply had to know how the story was going to end. Only a rare few would\\'ve been able to pre-guess the way the plot panned out.Get ready for more than a few \"please tell me you saw that!\" moments in this movie. This was the only title in 2022 that made me regret streaming it. I quietly wished I could observe how everyone else in the cinema hall may have reacted to some of the sequences that played out.Though \"Nope\" had a runtime that exceeded the two-hour mark, every minute was a lesson in good filmmaking. Peele has the power to break storytelling boundaries and rebuild them into something new. He showed so much without telling anything at all. This was one of the most gripping alien-encounter movies I have seen in years.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I haven't seen any of Peele's other movies, so I approached Nope without expecations. I watched it primarily for Michael Wincott, who is one of the most criminally underrated and underused actors today.The movie starts strong with a welcome but short appearance by the great Keith David in the opening scene. We're also introduced to Kuluyaa's essentially nonverbal protagonist, who I felt was one of the weaker aspects of the movie, since he seems too disconnected and unengaged considering the incredible occurances at the ranch. Frankly, the movie would have been stronger if they had replaced either lead with Keith David, because that man just oozes charisma.His sister on the other hand is mostly annoying, with the actress overacting as if she were in a different movie than everyone else. Overall the movie felt somewhat disjointed, especially during the opening 45 minutes until the mystery was revealed and the themes came together.Contrary to other reviewers, I found the monster to be unique and scary, and the finale engaging and suspenseful. For a monster movie, the final showdown is what it all comes down to, and Nope even remained suspenseful in a full lit daytime scene, much like Jaws. I liked that a lot.Less fun were some of the dumb decisions the characters make during the finale, especially Michael Wincott's character, who seemed like the one smart character for most of the film.From a technical and direction standpoint, this was stellar. Beautifully shot, great use of camera angles and sound, well paced during the suspense scenes.While the movie does suffer from either miscast or misdirected lead actors and a half baked script, overall I enjoyed it.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"We need more movies like Nope, solely for the ambition and sheer originality that this film brings to the table. It puts some very refreshing spins on a sci-fi plots and tropes that have been extremely overdone.Like Jordan Peele's other two films, this one has very stellar visual direction. Everything is so aesthetically pleasing and clearly presented in a way that the intended effect of every shot is very well-realised.Additionally, this film is extremely well-acted. The actors all clearly understand their characters and bring a lot to the story to elevate it far above what's on the page.That's quite the complement to the actors, because what's on the page is one of the clunkiest, most bloated screenplays I've seen all year.At over two hours long, Nope could have and should have been a tight 90-minute suspense ride. But it isn't.The first 30 minutes consist of very compelling character introductions that are then abruptly and completely abandoned in favor of meandering subplots regarding either hiding from an alien or getting an alien on camera.The climax is about 15 minutes too long and is almost unbearably repetitive, regurgitating the same two or three visual set pieces over and over again.There is an attempt to give the two lead characters some kind of cathartic emotional moment at the film's conclusion, but it's entirely unearned to kind of an embarrassing degree.This is definitely one of those movies in which the writer/director was given too much power and wasn't given enough notes, because of his first film's astounding success.If your clout makes you unable to take criticism during the creative process, eventually you're going to get a film like this, where a lot should have been cut or re-written, but wasn't.Still, there are so many good ideas and cool, original scenes in this film that I do recommend you check it out.\"},\n",

But to stay PG and on this aisle of being a good boy, I thought I go that way and avoid offending anyone. Of course my rating alone may be more than one reason for others to be offended. Because Peele once again removes himself from something like Get out - but if you really think about it, Us was already a departure from that.That all being said, we have a movie of way bigger scope and yet confined to a farm mostly. What happens on that farm stays on that farm? Not so much and no pun intended. There are a few things/ideas floating around (and my puns are on overdrive mode), but what exactly is happening? And what are we actually going to see. And what does it all mean? In the end we may not get a lot of answers, but we do get some throughout the movie - I can\\'t vouch for how much impact they will have on you (pun or no pun wise).I did watch the movie on an Imax screen - and even a few days later it is tough to rank this - not just generally speaking but also when talking about the other movies Peele has done. Is it better than or worse than - how does it compare to ... hopefully you can free yourself from those restrictions. Because it is easy to fall and rate this or have way too high (or other) expectations and make this not work.From a technical point of view (and not just because of the imax) this was well executed (not really a pun - maybe it is I don\\'t know). I do understand if you have issues with the CGI, which I thought was fine. Or how some characters are portrayed or their decisions. I was fine with all of that. But we are different and we perceive things differently. We may also not really see what is right in front of us. The friend I watched the movie with - she was able to see something in the costume of Steven Yeun, that I did not see and probably would have missed. Visual clues and hints are subtle and sublime at times - but they are there. And they actually do elevate the movie - there are probably way more that we both missed.The nods to ... other movies from the past (will not go into detail, but you\\'ll understand, though some western themes, even if this is anything but a western, are there and present) and even Black History and oppresion - or just what goes on on filmsets ... you don\\'t have to get all those. But they are not too subtle and can be easily spotted - especially in the beginning.Acting is more than fine - and if you can get down with the theme of the movie, with the slow pace and the general .. \"animalistic\" drive it has ... you\\'re in for a hoot (and have just survived another pun ... and another one right after) ...'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Only a few years ago we hadn\\'t heard of Jordan Peele, the director, whereas now, after only three films to his credit, and three \\'horror\\' films at that, he\\'s \\'a name\\' that can actually draw an audience to a multiplex and although his new film, \"Nope\" stars Oscar-winner Daniel Kaluuya I\\'m sure it\\'s Peele people are coming to \\'see\\'. The question is, after \"Nope\" will they be as quick to rush to the next Jordan Peele opus? Unfortunately, I think the answer may be nope.He won an Oscar for his first film \"Get Out\" which very cleverly blended racism, white supremacy and the Frankenstein myth into a fairly intoxicating brew. His follow up, \"Us\", wasn\\'t quite in the same class, settling in large part on the fright factor but in that department it certainly delivered. \"Nope\" takes us into the realm of sci-fi and while he again uses black leads, (Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as a brother and sister, both very good), their ethnicity isn\\'t really central. This is basically a homage to the kind of alien flics we enjoyed in the fifties, (think \"It Came from Outer Space\"), and with a better class of alien it might have been very enjoyable.Sadly Peele doesn\\'t seem to know that if you\\'re making a monster movie you need a convincing monster or at least a scary one and simply tweaking the flying saucer genre won\\'t cut the mustard. There are no real \\'jump\\' moments here, (there\\'s a subplot involving a killer chimp that never goes anywhere), and as \"Nope\" progresses it just gets sillier. This might have made for a good one hour episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" but stretched out to 130 minutes in an attempt to draw in the multiplex crowds, seems to me something of a con-trick. In a word, nope.'},\n",

Having already covered methodical, psychological horror and slasher/invasion style, Peele turns his attention towards the sky and our fascination with UFO's and aliens. You may have had some expectations based on the trailer, but put those aside. This is a Peele movie. You know it's not going to be what it seems. Every indication of this is demonstrated from the very opening when we get a bit of a non-sequitur involving some brutal animal horror. Don't worry, it's all related.After slowly ramping things up and giving us some scenes of dread and creating an inquisitive atmosphere, things kick into gear and the film doesn't let up until the very end. It has all the hallmarks of classic UFO pictures, but turns those on their heads by mixing genres. We get a little bit of western here, while also throwing in some creature feature bits. Everything mixes well to create something that feels fresh and new. The leads are all fantastic, with Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya each bringing a different kind of energy that bounce well off each other. Surrounded by an excellent cast, there's as much fun and humor to be had as there is tension. This is also easily the most fun and most watchable film there is, with the themes baked into the action and excitement. The last 30-40 minutes are some of the most exciting of any film in recent months and should keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration.If Nope proves anything, it's that Peele's ambition and storytelling are becoming ever grander. The scope here dwarfs previous efforts. From this, who knows, me may very well see something grand and blockbuster-ish from Peel in a few years.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This movie is \\'Tremors\\' for the sky. It\\'s the thing David Lynch would make if he saw \\'Arrival\\' and decided to adapt it into a California western. It was also totally riveting and weird.Having seen all 3 of Jordan Peele\\'s feature-length horror films, I can state confidently that I dig his style. Certain ingredients are predictable now, but they never make the plot anymore so. You can expect sharp costume design, well-timed comedy, and a banger soundtrack; but you can\\'t quite imagine what creation he\\'s going to be piecing together next. Perhaps that\\'s why \\'Nope\\' was so satisfying to watch.I\\'ll start with the things I don\\'t like about the movie, and they\\'re pretty simple. I wasn\\'t crazy about some of the acting direction, because sometimes Daniel Kaluuya and Brandon Perea (\"Angel\") behave aloof - and their reactions don\\'t always match the situation at hand, leaving me confused about the stakes. The dialogue is wry, and while oiled with humor, some lines fall flat or just miss their mark. I have to admit that this might be Peele\\'s weakest script of the three. People noticed. Lastly, and this is probably subjective, some elements left unexplained are fruitless red herrings; but as they could also be thematic chess pieces that I\\'m too dumb to work out, I\\'m letting it go.On the flipside, however, I was enthralled the entire runtime. Peele has really begun to master scene-making, such that the expositional bits never lost my attention because of his eye for interesting set-pieces and good chemistry (which was always engaging between Kaluuya and Keke Palmer). In \\'Nope\\', set-pieces also include the wardrobe, which was lovingly eccentric. I could never pull off most of those looks but they kept the characters unique and give insight into their character. Some outfits are even distracting, but I don\\'t mind enough to be mad. Former double-dutch star and spelling bee champion Keke Palmer presents with most of the fits and I really hope to see more of her in future films, because she was magnetic in all of her scenes, from the very first onward. The Disney Channel can\\'t hold back a star like that.Oh, yeah - this is also a horror film. Sometimes, especially when I\\'m laughing, it\\'s barely so. But the parts in which horror is ingrained are truly eerie, earned, and memorable. There are scenes with an ape that made me feel sick to my stomach. There\\'s creature design (mild spoiler) that is wholly unique, but in a way that feels practical and exciting and not for the sake of a gimmick. Peele draws serious effect from the use of people\\'s screams - something underappreciated in horror movies - and the consequence is real fear of what might be causing the din. Your imagination does the legwork. Simple sound design makes a major impact when things get tense.The past few years have felt like a horror movie recession. I do a lot of digging to find good films that don\\'t make it big in the theaters, and even to that end I\\'ve often come up disappointed lately. For \\'Nope\\' to hit screens in the same cycle as \\'Black Phone\\' feels, as you could expect, like a major breath of fresh air.6.5/10. I\\'m still thinking about the ape scenes.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I know a lot of people didn't like Jordan Peele's second movie, Us; but I thought it was brilliant. I actually prefer it to Get Out. (Just a teeny bit). So I was beyond excited when this movie was announced. Aliens aren't really one of my favourite sub-genres, however if it's done properly, it can be really good. This was not. I'm struggling to put into words what I just watched. The storyline was all over the place. It had an interesting beginning with the dad, then slowed a bit, then picked up, and then went to a weird place which it never came back from. The scariest part of the film was with the children in the barn, and that turned out to be a prank!! The effects weren't very good; the alien creature looked ridiculous. I'm so surprised Jordan Peele wrote this, it was a colossal disaster. I mean, a good story line but a terrible execution. Of all the possibilities you can take with this storyline, Jordan Peele ended up with this.....I don't even know what else to say. Glad I didn't pay money at the cinema for this.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Jordan Peele\\'s directorial debut-\"\\'Get Out\"-was a treatise in embedding social commentary within a mystery/sci-fi plot. His next film-\"Us\"-ramped up the mystery component while still maintaining the expert cultural commentary. Though personal taste may slightly shift star rankings on those two movies, at the end of the day they are both solid examples of thoughtful and thrilling filmmaking. Unfortunately, Peele\\'s \"Nope\" delivers an unfulfilled mystery without-for the most part-the strong characters/themes he is usually known for.For a very basic overview, \"Nope\" tells the story of OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) & Emerald (Keke Palmer) Haywood, a brother/sister duo trying to keep their Los Angeles horse-training ranch afloat in the wake of the mysterious death of father Otis (Keith David). The Haywoods discover that the ranch may be the site of extraterrestrial contact, and as such enlist the help of retail IT guy Angel (Brandon Perea) and crusty old cinematographer Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott) to capture definitive proof. At the same time, carnival huckster (and former child TV star) with a tragic past Ricky Park (Steven Yeun) may also be key to understanding the \"UFO\" mystery.For the first half of \"Nope\", I was fully invested. Peele constructs an engaging mystery A-plot (UFO/ranch material), supported by a B-plot (Park flashbacks/story) that is utterly fascinating and steals the show whenever it is presented. As such, I was primed and ready to see how Peele was going to dovetail those two threads into a remarkable climax.That excitement never came to fruition, however, as the film really stumbled to its conclusion as opposed to finishing strong. The resolution of the mysterious elements here are the most oblique from Peele to date, and it really takes some digging in and connecting fuzzy dots to make it all work. I\\'m normally not opposed to such an approach-but only when paired with strong characters. \"Nope\" does not feature this, as the characters are largely one-dimensional, over-the-top, or understated to the point of boredom. I never felt invested in any of their motivations or backstories. So, when the blurred-lines mystery took center stage for my viewing experience, that was not a great outcome.\"Nope\" is not a horrible film by any means. After some further thought/analysis, I can see (if still very obliquely) what some of the themes were getting at. It features some great visuals throughout, has some really suspenseful/enthralling individual scenes, and the setup is wonderful. But in the end, it doesn\\'t really gel into much of anything other than largely weak characters driving a mystery plot that was never supposed to be front-and-center in the first place.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'As a fan of Jordan Peele dating back to his Comedy Central days and then extending to his excellent works \"Get Out\" and \"Us,\" I was really looking forward to seeing his new film. The purposefully ambiguous marketing let viewers know to expect something unique and authentic, but also ensured that things wouldn\\'t get spoiled too much along the way. While it\\'s not quite perfect, I\\'m very happy to say that \"Nope\" is a highly well-made and engaging genre film that further cements Peele\\'s status as a strong filmmaker and perhaps one of the only true writer-director auteurs who regularly make films with broad, mainstream appeal (besides Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino, I\\'m not sure who else fits in that category now.)The film\\'s plot centers around a brother (Daniel Kaluuya) and sister (Keke Palmer) who run the Haywood Ranch, a ranch where film and TV productions are filmed located next to a Western-themed amusement park. Eventually, a UFO in the clouds comes along, and the creative characters Peele has drawn up will have to figure out how to survive it. Viewers should know that while there are some disturbing scenes, a lot of the film is less based in horror than \"Get Out\" or especially \"Us.\" Instead, the tone bends some psychological unease with Spielbergian blockbuster-style intrigue and spectacle, clever humor (there\\'s a lot more comic relief than there looks to be,) and character drama. When the film does go for a more ominous and suspenseful vibe, Peele is able to craft the tension masterfully and create a real reaction and impact on the audience. The acting is good across the board, and I thought Keke Palmer stood out the most in the cast. She is both charismatic and hilarious, but also able to fully carry a strong emotional range throughout the film. Additionally, her character seems less static than any of the other more major characters. While some casual audiences probably will not care for a more leisurely pace than \"Get Out\" or \"Us,\" I appreciated how much care Peele put into developing the characters and setting. The cinematography of the ranch/amusement park is gorgeous, and some of the VFX shots are pretty impressive too--especially in the third act. Peele clearly loves and is very talented in his craft, although I do think the third act could have used some work. It doesn\\'t hit the same character and emotional-based beats as the first two acts, and despite being higher on style than the previous two acts, it feels surprisingly much lesser in substance. Despite that noticeable shortcoming, \"Nope\" is otherwise a great entry into Jordan Peele\\'s filmography. It won\\'t be everyone\\'s cup of tea, but for attentive and patient viewers who appreciate Peele\\'s style of filmmaking, I gladly recommend it. 8/10.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I\\'ve put off writing this review for a couple of weeks as there\\'s something about me that doesn\\'t particularly want to be the outlier. I didn\\'t get \"Nope\", or I did, and I didn\\'t like it, I can\\'t decide.OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya) and his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) operate a Ranch outside Los Angeles, managing horses for film and TV productions in Hollywood. Following several strange occurrences, including the death of their father, OJ discovers that a UFO is regularly appearing over their ranch. They attempt to film it, but the electricity outages always stop them. Emerald calls in renowned cinematographer Antlers Hoist (Michael Wincott) but he\\'s unconvinced, until an incident at the next-door Theme Park persuades him otherwise.I suppose my problems with this stem from the fact that I enjoyed \"Get Out\" and \"Us\" so much, that the ... basicness ... for the want of a better phrase, of \"Nope\", was the surprise for me. Especially given the secrecy around the plot, and the trailer that didn\\'t give much away I was disappointed that the film lacked surprises. It was essentially \"Jaws\" I thought. OJ and Emerald discover an almost existentially dangerous threat, narrowly escape from it, then try to come up with a way to track it before finishing it off. In and of itself that\\'s not a bad thing, but I\\'m used to something more cerebral from Peele.But I\\'m willing to concede that the problem might be me. I don\\'t think I understood it, certainly and specially, the amount of time devoted to the Gordy subplot. Subsequent reading of various interpretations (some of which I feel are stretching it a bit) do make sense, I can see that the incident encouraged Jupe to take a risk with an unpredictable and potentially dangerous entity for financial gain. I will also say that I liked all the performances in the film and thought, perhaps with one exception, that the film looked really good.I don\\'t know. It really didn\\'t work for me and I can\\'t say I\\'ll be back to watch it again any time soon.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I have had a \"theory\" for a long time that the success or failure of movies in this day and age can usually be directly related to the quality of the screenplay - usually the story or the plot. I mean, cinema technology nowadays is fantastic; editing, cinematography, special effects are all great, and acting is usually decent. But it really comes down to the story, doesn\\'t it? I mean, it either makes sense and holds together or it doesn\\'t, and that to my mind is the failure of \"Nope\".\"The Sixth Sense\" was a tremendous movie with its once in a lifetime twist ending, but since then Shyamalan\\'s output has been at best mediocre. I mean, come on, movies like \"Signs\" or \"The Village\" or \"Lady in the Water\" are cringe-inducing. How does this guy keep getting studios to put up millions of dollars for garbage like that? It really seems as though Shyamalan had the one great inspiration with \"The Sixth Sense\" and has made a career of people hoping he has another one like that in him.I am a little concerned that Jordan Peele\\'s career is following the same trajectory. \"Get Out\" was tremendous, a deservedly big hit and award winner, but he has not lived up to its standard with \"Us\" and \"Nope\".I kept waiting for plot threads to come together and for the movie to stay true to its own internal logic, but it just didn\\'t. This was one of those movies where, when it ends, you just kinda go \"Wait! There must be something more to this. Is that really it?\"\\nHaving said that, Peele does succeed in creating an atmosphere of forboding, and, just like \"Us\" I enjoyed watching it even though I was in the end disappointed. He has a LONG way to go before he reaches the depths to which Shyamalan has fallen; let\\'s fervently hope he rights the ship long before then.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'There was a time, however briefly, when blockbusters were made by the same directors of the New Hollywood and weren\\'t just product placement intended to get toys into Target for a 6 week cycle, but actual movies that stirred up emotions and made us look into the unknown with wonder or terror. With just three films -- Get Out and Us precede this -- Jordan Peele has started to take the journey that others before him -- M. Night Shyamalan is just one example -- have tried and failed to navigate. Can filmmakers create challenging movies that appeal to audiences while having sometimes difficult to follow narratives and not underline and telegraph every single point they are trying to get across?In case you\\'re wondering, \"Just how big is this movie going to get?\" the answer comes with a Biblical verse that fills the screen: \"I will cast abominable filth upon you, make you vile and make you a spectacle.\" -- Nahum 3:6.The seventh in order of the minor prophets, Nahum was known as the \"comforter,\" despite his words mainly concerning the downfall of Assyria. They\\'re strong words; indeed, translator Rev. John Owen said that \"No one of the minor Prophets seems to equal the sublimity, the vehemence and the boldness of Nahum.\" His main message was that God will protect his faithful people and by doing so, will also destroy all of the violent human empires. You can consider his words a stiff rebuke against militarism and arrogance.From here on our...spoilers abound.After this, we see our first glimpse of Gordy\\'s Home, a 1998 sitcom about a chimp living with a human family. If the first message of Nope is right out there in writing before the movie even begins -- spectacle is what human beings crave and they\\'ll destroy themselves for it -- the second message takes time to come to light. It\\'s also quite simple: you can\\'t make deals with a predator. You can only change your behavior and slightly influence their own to survive alongside them, which is basically how animal training works.Predators can\\'t be tamed. At all.But before we get to the tragedy of Gordy the chimp, we need to get to the tragedy at the heart -- tragedies -- of Nope.Ranch owner Otis Haywood Sr. (Keith David) is the owner of Haywood\\'s Hollywood Horses Ranch, which has provided live horses to Hollywood productions since, well, before movies even existed. The Haywoods claim that the jockey in Eadweard Muybridge\\'s The Horse in Motion was their great-great (maybe just great) grandfather, a black man whose identity is lost in time while the white man who made the movie is remembered forever. As Otis and his son OJ (Otis Jr., played by Daniel Kaluuya) ready horses for a shoot, a rain of metal falls to the Earth with a nickel hitting the elder Haywood directly in the eye, killing him.The next time we see OJ, he\\'s becoming withdrawn, taking a horse to the set of a commercial that will be shot by cinematographer Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott, Top Dollar from The Crow; he\\'s also in Curtains, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Strange Days amongst many other great roles) and directed by an Flynn Bachman, played by Osgood Perkins (Norman\\'s son and the director of I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House).OJ\\'s sister Emerald (one-time Nickelodeon star Keke Palmer) arrives late and she\\'s his opposite; while he\\'s hard-working he has no idea how to act around human beings. She\\'s able to get an entire room of hardened Hollywood industry vets -- look for Donna Mills, she of The Eyes Have It and seeing as how important vision becomes later, that can\\'t be an accident -- on her side near instantly. Then, one of the horses freaks out when a crew member doesn\\'t listen to how important the boundaries of an animal are. The Haywoods are fired; they\\'ll just replace the animal with CGI, just like Gordy is throughout the film.Emerald catches a ride with OJ, as she has things back at the house that she wants. She\\'s a free-spirit where OJ often remarks on all of the mouths that he has to feed. Emerald has inherited the show business side of their father (right before the final plan comes together, she watches a video of him giving his pitch; this speech is word for word what she said on the commercial shoot) while OJ has the quiet put in the work side. As for their mother, it seems as if she died young and the kids ended up raising one another as much as their father raised them.On the way back to the ranch, Em encourages OJ to stop selling horses one at a time and to sell the entire ranch to their neighbor Ricky \"Jupe\" Park (Steven Yuen), who by no small twist of fate he\\'s the former star of Gordy\\'s Home who has taken his fame in some strange pathways. His new ranch, Jupiter\\'s Claim, is based on the movie Kid Sheriff that he made after Gordy\\'s rampage. Now the star of reality TV with his family, he has a hidden room filled with mementos of the show, including the bloody shoe that somehow stands perfectly upright after Gordy maims and kills his TV family, the Houstons (played by Sophia Coto as Mary Jo Elliott, Andrew Patrick Ralston as Tom Bogan and Jennifer Lafleur as Phyllis Mayberry). This part of the movie gets to the spectacle; in our world, I doubt very much that Saturday Night Live and Mad Magazine would outright make such satire of such a tragedy during which at least two people died. Yet Jupe repeats the sketch and keeps laughing about just how great Chris Kattan was in it (it\\'s to the credit of Peele\\'s love of comedy that everyone in this sketch is period accurate). However, throughout the film, we see young Jupe terrorized by Gordy, who had been frightened by a popping balloon, and now is covered in blood, demanding a fist bump and signing, \"Where is family?\" He\\'s gotten over it in the way that only a Hollywood person can, by exploiting the tragedy. And he\\'s not done yet.By the way -- in a cool twist of real life fate, the land of Jupiter\\'s Claim once belonged to civil engineer William Mulholland and the farmhouse land was at one point owned by director Howard Hawks.Why would Emerald want to sell her past? She feels no connection since her father broke his promise to teach her how to train her own horse -- Jean Jacket -- and spent that time with OJ instead.And now, a significant period of time into the film, we get our first ideas of what the plot is all about: there\\'s something in the sky eating organic material and spitting out the metal. OJ and Emerald decide to capture footage of it -- thereby creating something on film -- an \"Oprah shot\" -- that their name can be remembered by, unlike their great-great grandfather, and this takes them to Fry\\'s Electronics, where Angel (Brandon Perea) installs their surveillance equipment and near-immediately figures out that they\\'re looking for a UFO. After all, he saw them on TV.They\\'re also no longer UFOs. They\\'re Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, a name the government has given to them once everybody figures it all out. Interestingly, the idea of organic UAP or animals in the sky is not new; tentacles creatures, strange lines and even thunderbirds -- according to History Daily, the Tombstone Epitaph newspaper dated April 26, 1890 reported that two local ranchers killed an enormous and mysterious winged monster with a body nearly 90 feet long with a wingspan of 160 feet -- have been reported as aerial phenomena for decades.At the same time, Jupe has been planning a show called the Star Lasso Experience and it proves that he learned nothing from the night that Gordy went wild. He has been feeding the Haywood horses he\\'d bought -- horses trained over many years with specialized skills that are fed like they mean nothing -- to the alien that he calls \"The Visitor.\" He\\'s planned a special show -- there are many empty seats as for now -- and even invited Mary Jo, his fellow survivor and forever scarred first crush, to see the aliens in action. Well, everyone gets more than a front row seat.The deaths during this show finally convince the cinematographer Holst to visit the ranch and use his handcranked camera, tube man props and a wild plan to get the best imagery of a UFO ever taken. Hoist is seeking an impossible shot, one that he\\'s looked for his entire life, one that will cost him his life, but not before he intones a scratch-throated, eerie version of Sheb Wooley\\'s \"The Purple People Eater.\"Angel, OJ and Emerald barely survive the return of the creature -- sitting inside a never moving cloud, ready to reduce man\\'s electronic innovations to dead machines -- but they still get off luckier than the TMZ journalist -- and Akira motorcycle rider -- named Ryder Muybridge (Devon Graye, the writer of I See You and the Trickster on The Flash). They do learn that the creature -- which now looks like another anime reference, one of the angels from Neon Genesis Evangelion -- can be harmed when it eats inorganic matter that appears organic. OJ also learns that he must use what he always had -- his convictions, his ability to protect others, knowing not to look a predator in the eye or deal with it in human terms -- to save everyone.He also runs the track in the same way that the black jockey in Muybridge\\'s film once did, but now he\\'s not just a man on a horse. He\\'s a strong black man with agency, a heroic figure played by someone whose name -- Daniel Kaluuya -- we won\\'t forget. It\\'s no accident that one of the posters on the walls in the Haywood home is for Sidney Poitier\\'s directorial debut Buck and the Preacher, one of the first movies to show black cowboys, even if a quarter of all real life cowboys were black.Also, Jupe and Mary Jo -- mostly Mary Jo, what with her ruined face and prosthetic hand -- have been eaten up and spit back up by Hollywood. And yet here they are, demanding another time through the spectacle, even if they have to make a deal with potentially a devil to engender one of those bad miracles.Jupe grew up around an animal and his life was defined by how he distanced himself from the tr.'},\n",

His productions have improved dramatically. I recall 'Get Out' and actually laughing out loud at some of the production design, which was so low budget it looked like a Roger Corman movie from the 70s. 'Nope' has a much more polished and believable look with both production design, cinematography and effects.I just don't enjoy his approach to horror films, which I guess is okay.

Even editor as an afterthought. The obscure cast, with only the star power of Michael Wincott(Along Came A Spider, Metro, Alien Resurrection) does its job well.

An exceptional director who improves from film to film. With talented people such as these Hollywood is safe but the downside is that very few good movies are churned out each year.

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"Nope\" is a relatively new 2022 movie and this got hyped quite a bit long before its release already because it is the newest work from Oscar-nominated director and producer and Oscar-winning writer Jordan Peele. This time of course without Key next to him. Peele is also a prolific actor, but here he left this area to the ones that play the characters of this story. The big name to mention is Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya, who had his huge breakthrough with the movie that was also the big breakthrough for Peele himself and I really enjoyed \"Get Out\", so it also made me curious to see these two reunited here, even if I now must say the outcome is quite a disappointment. You can see that from my rating, but I will get to the details and explanations a little later. In-between the film I just mentioned and this one here, Peele worked on another film called \"Us\", a decent film as well, but inferior to \"Get Out\", yet superior to this one here, so Peele really went south quality-wise with every film he made, but this one here is at times so low that it is hard to imagine for me that his next project could be another step down in quality. First he focused on really human threats linked to racism (of course, but at least very creatively), next he focused on doppelgänger danger and there he also brought in supernatural elements and enemies and here he takes it to the next level as an alien invasion is about to happen. So this was definitely not an easy idea to turn into effect and, even more difficult, quality. I would not say he failed completely and I was even eager to give this film 3 stars out of 5 for the most part before the final sequence really made it obvious for me that I must give a negative recommendation here. No clue why critics loved it so much. The female protagonist is played by Keke Palmer here. She portrays the male protagonist\\'s sister and the longer the film goes, the more it becomes her film. Unfortunately not in a good way. More on that later on. She was an Emmy winner in a category that does not get too much attention, but her performance here did not make me curious at all about her future.It is really a mix of variety in here: Two Blacks in the lead and the perhaps biggest supporting character is played by Branden Perea. Don\\'t worry if you have never heard of the actor\\'s name. Neither have I. I must say he was okay with what he was given. Then there is Michael Wincott, an actor who is quite prolific, but also most will not identify him immediately, let alone remember his name. This film will not change anything about that. He plays an established filmmaker who initially rejects the main characters when they approach him, but finally becomes a vital part of the story. Or well, actually he almost always stays a nothing character who was supposed to be vital, but it is not working out. I don\\'t blame the actor though, just how his character was written. Then there is Steven Yeun, so it is not only an Asian actor on board, but one of the best Asian actors out there right now and what they (or Peele) did with him was just a bad joke. He was completely wasted. The scene when he stands there far away from the the trio and screams something was very telling. He just isn\\'t part of the action. You could almost say that the child actor that plays his character had more to work with in this bizarre monkey/ape killing sequence than Yeun does. What a disappointment! No idea why he would accept such a nothing role, maybe only because of Peele shooting the movie. Finally, Keith David, another fella with several Emmy wins, is on board here as well, but only featured prominently at the beginning. Not too much to say about him. He has solid screen presence, but that is it. Plays the father of the two leads, but vanishes as quickly as tragically. Then again, it was not difficult for him to shine here if you look at the fact that he shared the screen with Kaluuya in all his scenes because the latter was literally sleepwalking his way through the movie from beginning to end and he is in almost every scene, but he seems so lackluster. Now I am not a fan of Kaluuya in general, but I think he is a much better actor nonetheless than what you get to see here. I am not sure if it was his approach or how Peele wanted him to be, but it was an utterly forgettable performance.Maybe the reason was also that they wanted Palmer to shine so much and her character was the opposite of Kaluuya\\'s really. Just take the scene when she comes in for the photo shoot and presentation there of the animal trainer company. It all comes easy for her and the opposite is the case for her brother. How she talks to people, how she wins them over etc. Of course, she also has a dozen other talents and jobs, that\\'s how versatile she is. But don\\'t mistake Kaluuya\\'s turn for a quietly convincing performance or something. This is not the case either. It is just bizarre how forgettable his character is with all the screen time he has. Now does that automatically make Palmer\\'s character memorable? Absolutely not. Or if so, then for all the wrong reasons. I think she was supposed to be likable, supposed to be seen as a strong female character, but for me the opposite was the case and she did not feel realistic. Actually, she felt fairly obnoxious with her screaming out certain stuff like when she elaborates on the director\\'s camera model, when she references Oprah on several occasions, when she verbally declares war against the creature and so on. Also when she talks to Perea\\'s character on several occasions, she seemed the opposite of likable to me. But he happily takes it from such a great and self-confident woman like her, so we accept it too and don\\'t see it as something bad, rather as something positive with how headstrong she is? Oh well, I am not sold there at all. The fact that she is the opposite of her brother, who is even sleepwalking through the movie when riding a wild horse, does not make her a convincing character. Then, there were also other issues apart from the specific characters that I was not to big on. I found it an interesting idea how this film referenced crucial film history with the Black man riding a horse in the 19th century and how it is the first film in existence, but looking at how poor this movie here turned out to be, I wish they never would have mentioned this old short film or Muybridge as well. They deserve better and should not be a part of this chaos.Then there were several crucial question marks linked to the alien invasion and escalation. Of course, we have the stupid White man on his motorbike who of course gets killed. That was so stereotypical. I already mentioned the final sequence then when the woman at the center of the story basically defeats the evil creature on her own because of how smart and also in good shape she is. Not surprising really with how Hollywood wants to give it all to female characters/actors these days, but it was a mess. The two guys were just there resting somewhere until Palmer\\'s character had finished her divine act. Of course, the moment she basically got the creature to implode in the most laughable manner possible, tons of people arrive out of nowhere and see what she achieved. Of course, let\\'s not talk about the absence of police and even the military from this film for the most part. Makes total sense of course because these two would have thought the main characters are crazy with their idea that there is an alien out there. But now, as I get closer to the end of my review, let me also talk about a few things I found alright, not that there was really a lot. The best aspect maybe for me was the cloud idea. The footage of how all the clouds were moving except the one that contains (or even is) the creature was quite nice. The aforementioned ape/monkey sequence was fine too with how shocking it was. The idea of how the horse is scared early on at the film shoot because it saw its reflection was a good inclusion too, even if that felt clumsy at the same time in showing us how Kaluuya\\'s character is really a professional and these stupid White men surrounding him there, agents etc. Are just incompetent fools and he is much smarter than they think he is and also than they are. Obviously.What is, on the other hand, among the worst moments from the film again was how the male protagonist remembered something from his early scene and it helped him in fighting the creature and that was linked to (not) looking it in the eye. Aside from that, the early O. J. joke was quite something. No surprise here that Peele also had to get in some racism, even if I must admit I found the lady\\'s reaction and question kinda funny, but hey let\\'s perceive it as the blatant racism it was meant to be. What else? I am generally a western lover and even if this film here is not from the old days of movies or set back several centuries in the past, you can call it a western to some extent with the way where it is set, how many horses show up here and what the main character\\'s profession is. So I do not hesitate to say it is one of the worse western movies I have seen, maybe worst if we focus on modern genre movies. As I stated earlier, it was mostly the \"spectacular\" ending with Palmer\\'s character that ruins it and how she is still ready to say something like how nobody should mess with her name or so when she realizes she won. All on her own. As a consequence, I give this relatively long 130-minute movie a thumbs-down and suggest you skip the watch. Even if you liked Peele\\'s previous two releases, this is not one for you. I kinda believe now that he just got lucky somehow with \"Get Out\", but does not have it quality-wise to stay a reliable filmmaker for years to come, even if he is really not that old. Slightly over 40 now. If we are honest, then it was mostly Oscar winner Lupita Nyong\\'o\\'s lead performance that kept a shoddy script together in \"Us\". With this one here, the flaws cannot be ignored anymore.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Nope (2022)4/4Some movies have such unique visuals that you can identify the director and even the visual style. \"Nope\" is an example of unique visuals and interesting scenery, and is a film that is absolutely brilliant with its story, too. The film is mainly a horror-thriller, but also gets around as a comedy and even a touch of classic mystery. This is the kind of film that movies are made of - beautiful visuals for the eyes to feast on, a great screenplay to both listen to and watch unfold, and superb - and I mean superb - direction from writer-director Jordan Peele. \"Nope\" is Peele\\'s third film as a director, and he shows he is truly capable of making a great movie.The film is about two horse wranglers and their ranch, who live in the inland skirts of California, with nothing much more than a view of beautiful canyons. The ranchers are played by Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, But they\\'ve both got a special job, that of working for films, as animal wranglers. But their quiet, uninterrupted lives change when something odd begins to occur that doesn\\'t seem quite right - and it\\'s far beyond human life.I won\\'t spoil anything. I don\\'t want to be that person. But I will tell you that there are multiple heart pounding scenes involving what\\'s off, like a certain quietness to the whole thing, or a darker atmosphere than before. Like all great horror filmmakers, Peele knows what\\'s going to happen, but manipulates the audience in a way so we sit there in our seats, scared and unprepared, for what\\'s next. It is also a great homage to many great, sweeping films with dazzling visuals. The most distinctive part of \"Nope\" is its visuals, full of unique style and eerie beauty. Another distinctive part of the film is Peele\\'s secret weapon, Daniel Kaluuya, the star of his own \"Get Out\" and his expressive facial emotion. With his horrified face, one cannot help but fear for the worst - a trick Peele knows he has, and uses to its full advantage. Walking out of \"Nope\", all I could think about was how beautiful and intense the whole thing was. It was certainly better than \"Us\", Peele\\'s second film, which was good all the way up to the last 15 minutes, but I don\\'t think it was as good as my number one pick for 2017, \"Get Out\" Peele\\'s other, debut film. But there is one thing in common between \"Get Out\" and \"Nope\" - they\\'re both on my own personal best of the year lists.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Jordan Peele is a Legendary Director when you're talking about weird mysterious horror flicks. Get Out is amazing, and Us is good enough. Nope was very careful in not revealing anything in its first few pieces of Promo, but we started getting some more information with the newer Trailers.The movie is a pure spectacle, which is a word being tossed around a whole lot in reviews for this film. It looks beautiful, and I really recommend seeing it on the Biggest Screen Possible, so you can get the experience. All the characters are likeable and fun to interact with, with Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya being the standouts. Their brother-sister bond and banter is what ties a lot of this film together, and all the Supernatural Sci-Fi elements in the movie are amazing, and those combined with the breathtaking visuals make this film one that pops when looking at the year's best movies. And there are a lot of good scares and frightening scenes in this film too, so overall, a VERY enjoyable and great movie from Jordan Peele. Definitely on the level of Get Out, and if I see the movie for a second time, I might favour Nope over Get Out. 8.5/10 right now. Subject to change after rewatch.\"},\n",

Also it eats statues and trash without eyes because those are the rules of a hungry spaceship. Characters are buffoons and not likable the first hour is just dry banter and silly dancing scenes.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'The Good: This is easily one of the most visually stunning films I\\'ve seen all year. Every scene in Nope is so expertly shot, every image is so vivid, even when what we\\'re looking at might be mundane (which isn\\'t often, by the way). The nighttime scenes are so fantastic; I can\\'t remember the last time I\\'ve seen a movie where everything happening at night is so clear, yet still feels like nighttime. The IMAX cameras certainly paid off here.You know how some films are so obviously filmed on a set and it\\'s really distracting? Nope is the exact opposite; it\\'s so clearly a real place and whoever found this location deserves a raise. It\\'s such a self contained, but massive movie at the same time. I can go on forever about how gorgeous this movie looks.I also loved how it drips with Americana: Westerns, UFO sightings in the dry American West, and Hollywood are about the most American things ever. This film really has a sense of place and identity; it\\'s one of those films that could\\'ve only come from the United States. I like this when movies from other countries do this, so it\\'s nice to see an American film feel uniquely...American.Nope is a slow burn and it doesn\\'t hold your hand. Its story is deeply connected to its theme and I totally understand why audience reaction is so mixed. Nope doesn\\'t explicitly shout its themes and ideas at you; it\\'s one of those movies that you ponder about, interpret; it\\'s intellectually stimulating and an amazing spectacle at the same.The performances are out of this world (pun intended). Kaluuya is amongst the best leading men in Hollywood today. He brings so much pathos to this quiet, contemplative role and you can tell how he\\'s feeling and what he\\'s thinking just by his facial expressions. He\\'s such a well written, well developed character. Palmer is unreal as Emerald and her brother-sister dynamic with Kaluuya\\'s OJ is one of the best depictions of this relationship I\\'ve ever seen. All the characters are just so well done here; Angel (Brandon Perea) was one of those guys in a movie you hope would be in it for longer and like the genius Peele is, of course he ends up being a central character.But honestly, Steven Yuen gives such a powerful, interesting, and tragic performance as a former child actor haunted by an on set accident. His attempts to move beyond his trauma by monetizing it and his misguided beliefs as a result of it are the thematic crux of the movie. That so many audience members walked away questioning \"the point\" of his story is unbelievable to me.Oh yeah, and for an alien movie, this is about as great as it gets. Nope isn\\'t a terrifying film, but it\\'s tense, in the way Jaws was. Every time the UFO is nearby - whether on screen or not - it instantly raises the tension. The \"anti-electric field\" the UFO brings with it is such a brilliant tension generating device akin the musical score of Jaws or the shaking water of Jurassic Park. Peele has created one of the best movie monsters in years with Nope.There are two scenes in particular - one directly involving the UFO and the other, thematically related - that are honestly nightmarish in execution. Horrifying stuff, yet super restrained.The Bad: Where Nope falls flat for me is its runtime. As much as I adore this movie, I do think it\\'s a bit longer than necessary and takes a bit too much time getting to its points. If they cut about 10 minutes from the film, I think it\\'d be a bit tighter. But honestly, this is a pretty minor complaint.The Ugly: Jordan Peele is the only director I can think of where the question audiences ask going in is...\"what is this one going to be \\'about\\'?\" About not in the sense of plot, but thematically. What social commentary will he bring to us, will it work?Nope, to me, is about film making and the kind of unnatural, unbelievable, incredible things we do to capture the perfect shot or tell the perfect story. It\\'s about the relationship between humans and animals and our attempts to tame nature. It\\'s about monetizing tragedy and dealing with grief. It\\'s...not actually about aliens, which is kind of amazing. Peele uses the UFO as a narrative tool to tell so many other stories.In terms of where this stands in his already impressive filmography, Nope is probably the most well rounded of all his films. Whereas Get Out had excellent writing but kind of looked like a TV movie, and Us looked very expensive and professional, but fell a bit short on the writing, Nope nails it on both levels. I still think Get Out is my personal fave, but Nope is probably his best film yet.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"What\\'s A Bad Miracle? They Got A Word For That?\"Jordan Peele has already established himself as an absolutely exceptional talent of the 21st century with Get Out and Us.Nope is Peele\\'s first foray into blockbuster cinema. It\\'s a gigantic film in which Peele fully unleashes his auteur filmmaking skills on the audience. The film pays homage to Spielberg (Jaws & War of the Worlds) and is brimming with Peele\\'s trademark biting commentary and metaphors. The brilliant irony of the film, which addresses our dangerous obsession with the spectacular, is that Nope itself is a gigantic spectacle that takes possession of the viewer and doesn\\'t let go until the credits roll.Peele here is processing in a way how he rose to cinematic nobility with his groundbreaking Get Out screenplay and how it all unfolded so quickly for him. From witty impressionist to auteur filmmaker and top Hollywood director, his influence on the media has skyrocketed in the blink of an eye. Nope seems to be Peele\\'s admission that becoming an \"event filmmaker\" is a struggle. He loves making movies. But the lifetime contract of fame he had to sign to do so brings a dichotomy. It makes us, the audience, his biggest problem. He now has to create art and satisfy the masses at the same time.The most surprising aspect for me is the incredibly strange, grueling and electrifying tension of the film. Peele creates a unique atmosphere here - through the interplay of Hoyte van Hoytema\\'s (Interstellar!) great visual composition, the droning, eerie score reminiscent of Signs, and the strong cast. Daniel Kaluuya is absolutely brilliant, definitely one of the most talented actors of our time.What Jaws was to 1975 and the 70s, Nope will be to 2022 and the rest of the 2020s. It is a film that simultaneously defines and reinvents the genre. A brilliant, seemless fusion of science fiction, horror & western.With Nope, Jordan Peele undeniably joins Tarantino, Mann, Nolan and co. In the Hall of Fame of auteur filmmakers. I can\\'t wait for his next project.2022 is bursting with creativity. Cinema is becoming devoid of ideas? Hell nah!'},\n",

There's a very creepy, realistic scene at the movie's epicenter that left me staring with my mouth agape, glued to the screen. It didn't necessarily have anything to do with the central storyline but it was arguably one of the scariest scenes I've seen in recent years for oddly specific reasons. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.This next paragraph contains spoilers so prep yourself if you haven't seen it:There's a scene where a monkey attacks and kills a room full of innocent actors during a cute and funny tv production. There's no music, no jump scares, just screams and yells of humans and animal alike as blood sprays about. The film builds this up at uses it to juxtapose the dark sides of creatures and how they can't be tamed. For me, it's absolute nightmare fuel. I love monkeys. I've wanted to help rehabilitate them. This scene was so disquieting for me that it put me off of them, at least for a bit, especially given the set up (something harmless and friendly) and the characters surrounded. What's worse is that after the fact, this story is used as publicity and then scene as something humorous? It's so dark and legitimately terrifying. From the very beginning, I was wondering how this bloodied monkey had anything to do with the plot. I wanted answers so bad. Once the rampage on the set happened and I got the clarification, the aliens weren't too scary to me. That scene was so horrifying that it made the central antagonist of the film seem so pathetic in comparison.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and Em (Keke Parker) Haywood had inherited the sprawling ranch of their father, Otis Haywood Sr. (Keith David), who was killed in a freak accident involving a coin that fell down from the sky. As they encountered financial woes at the ranch, OJ grudgingly sold their trained horses to nearby Jupiter\\'s Claim, a small cowboy-themed amusement park owned by Korean-American ex-child actor Ricky \"Jupe\" Park (Steven Yeun).One night, while OJ was out patrolling the ranch, he encountered a strange object moving in the sky. Its presence would cause horses to react wildly and the power in various electrical and other devices around to fluctuate and turn off. To document the phenomenon, the siblings go to the local Frye\\'s Electronic store the next day to invest in camera equipment, which the friendly salesman Angel Torres (Brandon Perea) helped set up.The two previous films by Jordan Peele, \"Get Out\" (2017) and \"Us\" (2019) both had deeper messages of race and societal behavior in them. In comparison, \"Nope\" told a pretty straightforward story of an alien being in the sky terrorizing the people below. Race did not seem to be an issue here. The Haywoods just so happened to be African-American folk, but this story could have happened to anyone in that area under which the alien lurked.The characters were interesting and the actors playing them made them very likable. OJ and Em have totally contrasting personalities -- Daniel Kaluuya\\'s OJ was glum and tight-lipped, Keke Parker\\'s Em was effusive and gregarious. Kaluuya\\'s unique facial features, especially his piercing eyes, looked perfect for the eerie and mysterious atmosphere of this film. Parker\\'s energy kept the mood always up especially in the slow-burn, talky first act.Steven Yeun\\'s Jupe Park had a traumatic backstory that was only tangential to the alien story, yet prominently featured, as he used this old experience of his to keep himself relevant and profitable. A scene-stealing role was that of Angel Torres, played by up and coming Filipino-American actor Brandon Perea. He had a strong screen presence, winsome charisma and sense of humor which should earn him more high-profile roles in the future.The technical aspects of this film was its best draw. The cinematography by the acclaimed Hoyte Van Hoytema (\"Interstellar,\" \"Dunkirk,\" \"Tenet\") was beautiful and breathtaking capturing the vast cloudy skies. The film editing by Nicolas Monsour (\"Us\") worked with the music of Michael Abels (\"Get Out,\" \"Us\")) effectively evoked a sense of danger, dread and excitement during the scenes with the alien.Jordan Peele strangely began the whole film with an unsettling incident of a chimpanzee gone amuck in a film set, returning to give more details about it only by the second act. This issue of animal actors was also tackled in an incident when one of OJ\\'s horses acted up in a commercial set involving cinematographer Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott) and actress Bonnie Clayton (81-year old \"Knot\\'s Landing actress Donna Mills).Peele paid tribute to the art of film-making itself here. He cited Eadweard Muybridge\\'s 1884-85 photographic study of animal movements called \"Animal Locomotion,\" a progenitor of motion pictures, when Em claimed that the jockey on the galloping horse in \"Plate 626\" was their ancestor. He put Holst\\'s old, bulky, hand-cranked film camera side by side with Torres\\' new sleek digital camera. Just too bad we did not see the movies they captured.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Nope, a dark pop nightmare of uncanny science fiction and complex social thriller that unpacks the seeds of violence, risk and opportunism that are inseparable from the romanticized history of the American West, and from show business itself, is the third movie from writer/director Jordan Peele.Nope is situated just outside of Los Angeles, in Southern California\\'s arid and rambling Santa Clarita Valley, where siblings OJ Haywood (Kaluuya) and Emerald Haywood (Palmer), have inherited a horse ranch from their industry-legend father, Otis Haywood Sr. Carrying the torch of his craft as animal wranglers for film and television. It\\'s a tough business, and despite their skills and the artistry of their profession, OJ and Emerald face financial challenges and the heartbreak inherent to a trade where livestock is the talent. Adjacent to the Haywood ranch sits Jupiter\\'s Claim, a family-fun theme park and petting zoo predicated on the white-washed history and aesthetics of the California Gold Rush, owned and operated with evangelical pride by Ricky \"Jupe\" Park (Yeun), a former child star who is saddled with a tabloid-tragic backstory that he has spent a lifetime trying to escape.OJ and Emerald begin observing unexplained phenomena on their vast ranch that leads them down an obsessive rabbit hole-plotting attempts to capture the mystery on camera. The hijinks of their quest for documentation, through increasingly elaborate and dangerous set-ups, puts at risk the only thing they truly have: the hard-earned business of their late John Henry-esque father, who has left them in his long shadow. Things escalate, as the siblings enlist the expert help of Fry\\'s Electronics store employee Angel, and acclaimed cinematographer Antlers Holst, who is on the cusp of retirement. As their efforts, and hubris, cross a point-of-no-return, ratcheting the stakes to terrifying consequences, our heroes are drawn straight into the eye of an irreversible storm. The result is an expansive horror-spectacle with an intimate and emotionally complex core.Daniel Kaluuya and Jordan Peele are quickly becoming a teamup for the ages. A complete 180 from his likeable, affable everyman in Get Out, here in Nope Kaluuya barely speaks. A stoic man who only talks when necessary, Kaluuya plays OJ Haywood as a man who doesn\\'t say anything not worth saying. A man of drive and purpose, OJ\\'s determination on always moving forward is one of the main drives of the story. Proving that his Academy Award winning turn in Judas and the Black Messiah wasn\\'t a fluke, Kaluuya\\'s turn here in Nope rivals and possibly surpasses that of Chris Washington from Get Out.Even though Kaluuya is the Robert DeNiro to Peele\\'s Scorsese, and hopefully a combination that lasts far into the future, it\\'s Keke Palmer that steals the show. Every scene she\\'s in, it\\'s almost impossible to focus on anyone else. Exploding into the film with a charm and charisma that\\'s off the charts, Palmer\\'s performance quiets drastically once things get serious, but she somehow never loses her charm or playful mischievous nature. If Nope doesn\\'t turn Palmer into a bona fide movie star, nothing will.Also starring Steven Yuen as Ricky Park, a former child actor and owner of a carnival, the Walking Dead actor continues his hot streak of brilliant decision making in working with Jordan Peele. As the carnival owner trying to capitalize on the appearance of the film\\'s antagonist, Ricky is a clear condemnation of spectacle over substance. A character with a deeply traumatic past as a child actor, Ricky\\'s past is touched upon a few times (and definitely the film\\'s most upsetting scene) but never fully explored. While there\\'s hints and theories online, the scenes of Ricky\\'s past and how they tie into the main story might be the film\\'s biggest conundrum and also its weakest part. Still, for the brief amount of time Yuen is on screen, his charm is undeniable while interacting with both OJ and Emerald as well as his audience.As writer/director Jordan Peele\\'s third feature length film, Nope proves that he\\'s grown into a man fully in command of his abilities. At 131 minutes, there\\'s nary an ounce of fat on the film; every second is used to either further the plot, progress a character, or establish a mood. Sticking with his penchant for keeping his cast of characters relatively small, everyone gets their time to shine. Peele and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema use the camera to force the audience\\'s eye where Peele wants it to go, not where the audience wants. Through this, the persistent frustration of not being able to focus on what you want shows Peele\\'s deliberate command over viewers as the journey unfolds. A minimalist film, the production design doesn\\'t have a lot going for it; while the vast majority of the movie takes place at the Haywood Ranch and surrounding areas, Peele and van Hoytema take full advantage of photographing the wide open expanse of the land, making Nope (possibly) his most beautiful looking movie to date, which shouldn\\'t be surprising as van Hoytema has been behind the camera for the likes of directors such as Christopher Nolan, Sam Mendes, and James Gray. It\\'s no secret many a Hollywood cinematographer struggles with lighting people with dark skin, but thanks to van Hoytema, there\\'s a beautiful nighttime look at Kaluuya that displays thought and care on how light bounces off dark skin that hasn\\'t been seen since Moonlight.Overall, Nope proves that Peele continues to be one of the film industry\\'s most thoughtful and creative directors. While it\\'s difficult to label the movie as a horror film, his penchant for creating tense situations through outstanding direction, editing, and (sometime lack of) score creates incredibly unsettling vibes that permeate throughout the runtime. Keke Palmer\\'s vibrant personality, measured against Kaluuya\\'s stoic, efficient delivery creates an amazing mesh of on screen chemistry between the pair that results in some of the film\\'s best moments: siblings bickering one moment and bonding another. Once again, Peele\\'s use of genre to tell stories that are dripping with symbolism and hidden meaning are bound to create conversation and think pieces for weeks after its release. Better than Us while not quite reaching the highs of Get Out, Nope still manages to stand on its own as a film that is a prime example of how to effectively blend tones while presenting a compelling story that enthralls, horrifies, and delights.'},\n",

Well funded, professional cast and crew and yet it produced a movie that would not have any repeat attraction.CHARACTERS. I found I didn't like any of the characters. Kaluuya's character is dull and completely unemotional. Palmer, his sister is plain irritating. The other two main male cast members are throw-away characters. You don't care if they live or die. In fact you don't mind if some actually die. The exception is Yeun whose character I did like and wanted to see more of his backstory and development.ACTING. I didn't enjoy any of the acting. None of these actors are people that would draw me to a movie. Again Yeun is a slight exception but would still not be a major draw.PLOT. Silly, random. No real logic to it. Too many loose ends not really explained. Several very stupid plotholes that distract from the movie. There is a subplot about a chimp on a TV set that is far more interesting than anything in the main plot. I want to see that chimp movie and not this.The trailer has some scenes that were not in the movie I saw on a streaming service.

There is no emotional connection between characters; therefore there is no connection between audience and the movie.

Throughout the movie they steel, loot and cheat, everything and anything is ok as long as you're not found.

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"Nope\" is in very wide release, including at my neighborhood local, and it has been reviewed favorably by A.0. Scott and Anthony Lane, so I thought I\\'d give it a try. It\\'s a crazy mishmash of a sorta sci-fi thriller + some other stuff (think Westerns via \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\") and, as is the way with such films, it makes progressively less sense as the end approaches and the screenwriter/director, Jordan Peele, has to find a way to wrap it all up, but even then it\\'s enjoyable. There are unspecified aliens involved (who have their moods -- they -- or perhaps It -- can be petulant) but it does remain earthbound.In contrast to the much-ballyhooed \"Dune\", for example, \"Nope\" is visually very engaging, and it actually has lots of wit and a sense of humor. The characters are a bit flat -- written in soapoperatic mode, which means that they more the sum of their individual, instantly-identifiable tics than well-rounded humans, but most of he actors actually transcend this at many points, if not throughout. Daniel Kaluuya, a British newcomer (at least to me), in particular, is remarkable. Particularly remarkable is how unremarkably he is (and asserts himself as) the lead, as a Black man who, in complete unselfconsciousness (and with help, I would guess, from a world-class dialect coach), makes no concessions to whiteness. To see a wide-distribtuion commercial film whose lead is Black, with a White sidekick/subordinate, should not be so startling (and refreshing), but there it is, and should be noted. And I certainly hope we\\'ll be seeing lots more of Kaluuya going forward.What hooked me particularly was how so much of the film, in mood and approach (and even, in places, in its sound world), is reminiscent of the great Apichatpong Weerasethakul-- I would refuse to believe that Peele had not seen \"Memoria\" before making this one. It\\'s Apichatpong for general distribution, so those long, nearly-silent takes are foreshortened, and it has a very effective score, which you\\'d never find in an Apichatpong film, and the allusive metaphysics are, uh, simplified. But so much of \"Nope\" is so strikingly evocative of his work that this cannot be a coincidence.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'When Jordan Peele brought \"Get Out\" to the world, it truly was a sensation. I don\\'t remember much about Us -but I do feel like Nope will be in our mind for a bit now.The movie starts off with a great sense of mystery and comedy, slightly more focused on the comedy side. It\\'s based on this horse ranch on a beautiful location of Agua Dolce, CA (which they actually use the name in the movie). I loved the cinematography and the visuals throughout the movie. Loved the frequent handheld shots towards the sky. The UFO felt real and intimidating for the most part. It didn\\'t suffer from a problem where it loses its capture once the audience sees it. Great sound design overall. Really feel like this was an IMAX movie, which I wasn\\'t really aware of before viewing.Peele also managed to bring so much out of everyone\\'s performance. Kaluuya as OJ, Palmer as Em, Perea as Angel were phenomenal. I especially enjoyed Perea as he\\'s a lesser name known on film but I found his comedic presence really outstanding throughout the movie. Palmer was great too and sort of reminded me of Ted Lasso because of her easy going attitude. About Steve Yeun, who was mostly the reason why I was drawn to the movie in the first place, felt a little underused but his character definitely felt like it suit him enough. It was quite fascinating to see him on the big screen as I\\'ve only seen him on my tablet while binging Walking Dead, Minari and Okja. All the characters felt different, real and full of life and I think they contribute to the movie so much.\"Nope\" isn\\'t Peele\\'s known \"genre\" of movies. In my opinion, it deviates quite far from the horror element that he was known for. This movie is closer to a cosmic horror but I wouldn\\'t classify it as that. I found none of it \"scary\", but perhaps putting me on the edge of my seat a little. There\\'s an underlining lightheartedness (not the kind of Thor) to the overall movie that really lifts the pressure off the audience to view it as a \"horror\" movie. I do think the comedy element was great -whole theatre burst at laughing quite a few times. As for myself, I tried to interpret the \"meaning\" behind this movie as Peele has had a pattern of skillfully integrating substantial racial themes into his movies. Perhaps that distracted me a little bit because I think this movie isn\\'t supposed to be interpreted in that way. As Peele said himself, he wanted to make a \"spectacle\" and indeed it was. Maybe you can interpret it as like black man\\'s struggle trying to find his identity and create his own legacy in the world of filmmaking. But that\\'s a bit of a stretch and certainly not as profound as his other movies were. I tried to find meaning in the Gordy bit too but nothing came to fruition. All of this made me think that this movie was to be simply enjoyed, not analyzed and interpreted to the bits.However, it did have his downturns in some moments. I felt that it started to become slightly childish towards the end and drawn out. Perhaps shaving off 10 min at the end would have done a great benefit to the movie. Ending felt a little less satisfactory than I hoped. Music overall was underwhelming and I feel like a better score could have augmented the movie so much.In the end, \"Nope\" is a great addition to Peele\\'s impressive filmography and I would watch another Peele movie in a heartbeat.'},\n",

The film has some beautiful cinematography and some great funny dialogue typical of Jordan's humor. Strange things start occurring and you see things from the sky that look like UFO's. Jordan really builds the tension really well with the scary moments and funny moments as well. I really liked the performances in this film. Keke Palmer had some really funny lines and delivered them really well. I loved the score and the real trip I felt experiencing such an interesting concept for a horror film.

A combination between jellyfish and a balloon? It's final transformation into a big white flying figure is a final fantasy ripp-off last boss evolution done by a three years old.The part with the director and his non digital camera is, I suppose a critics of hunters combined with a critics of Hollywood traditional cinema ?

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'The trailers for this movie had a sense of foreboding that made this a must-see for me, this summer. A sci-fi/horror blend from Jordan Peele, who has shown a great ability to meld horror with social commentary without making the audience feel he\\'s preaching or talking down to us.Sadly, this is a misfire. It started slowly, building tension toward a big reveal that happens far too early, with characters making decisions based on information that they just seem to know intuitively, rather than some learning process or logical progression. And one character makes a decision that makes no sense from what goes before, and adds nothing to the outcome of the events.And it\\'s a shame, because for a film that\\'s shot in mostly earth tones, it\\'s a real visual treat. If you\\'re a fan of Peele\\'s prior work, it would be worth seeing just for the spectacle of it all. But if not, you\\'ll leave feeling like you\\'ve watched a filming of an early script draft.So much potential, so little payoff. I\\'m willing to suspend belief to a great extent, and plot holes usually slip right past, but the ones here are so gaping you could drive a semi into them.My advice: Pull this from theaters, finish it properly, then rerelease it. Call it \"The Director\\'s Cut,\" with lots of fanfare as to how the studio wouldn\\'t let him make the movie he wanted, release that, and I\\'ll make a second trip to see it, pay for that second ticket and take the whole family.This could be a great movie, with just a few minor rewrites, and very little reshooting. But as it stands, it doesn\\'t reach mediocrity. And that\\'s too bad, because I really wanted to like it.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Jordan Peele's homage to the moviemaking of the American west is an ambitious film and praiseworthy for its ultimate intentions. It's a film that touches on western, horror and science fiction and suspense themes. An austere soundtrack is another one of the film's strengths. While it can be described as genre-bending, it's unfortunately also patience-bending. Despite a knack for making haunting, creepy scenes in the middle of the desert and generating paranoia about the threat of extraterrestrial life, Peele simply takes too long to get to the meat of the film, which is the final confrontation.Solid, committed performances from Daniel Kaluuya and Steven Yeun rescue this from being a modern-day B-movie. Brandon Perea, on the other hand, is an utterly meaningless gadfly whose character gets way more screen-time than is warranted. The always commanding Keith David gets little more than a cameo in the early part of the film. Michael Wincott is effectively creepy as an aging, old school filmmaker. At the heart of this film is Keke Palmer whose fierce, occasionally dumb heroine is fighting to save the world but also make her own contribution to the world of UFO coverage.Although this was just a workmanlike film in the end, it's a good sign that Peele has not lost his ambition or drive to reach new heights in his filmmaking. I look forward to more of his offbeat work and cutting social commentary. Recommended.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Nope is a movie directed by Jordan Peele so I would say automatically, I am going to be anticipated for this film. Say what you want about Peele, but what he does it's original. This film focuses on a brother/sister team of horse trainers for Hollywood productions (Keke Palmer & Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya) who inherited the business after their father (Keith David) is killed when debris falls from the sky. Emerald (Palmer) wants no part of the business, while OJ (Kaluuya), due to his dwindling financial straits, is slowly selling off his stock to a neighboring showperson, played by Steven Yeun. All of this takes a backseat to the flying saucer haunting the area, which at first starts to kill off horses, but soon humans seem to be on the menu as well. Plus, the commentary in this movie is remarkable; many people don't understand what Peele wants to say with his movies, and people just don't read the lines in this film his commentary is about; the idea is a spectacle; we go to extreme lengths to receive and show entertainment. Just like the director and the TMZ motorcyclist where they want to record the situation. The twist where the flying saucer was the monster was just brilliant. Plus, with the scenes, Gordy the monkey was terrifying and is another symbol of how we love to abuse animals; that is why we see Gordy going on a rampage in the studio. Overall, Jordan Peele makes new fresh movies, and this film does that for me; better than Us, but not better than Get Out. 8/10.\"},\n",

It is a little slow in places and it's not quite as good as his previous 2 films, but it is still worth a watch. Daniel and Keke run a horse ranch with their father-they rent out their horses for commercial uses. Steven plays a former child star that runs a cowboy theme park next door and he rents horses from them. When Daniel and Keke's father is killed under mysterious circumstances-random objects fall from the sky and impale him-they think it's the work of a UFO that has been hiding in a cloud above their ranch. They enlist the help of Brandon-an electronics expert-to set up cameras to capture evidence. The only problem is the power goes off when they are being visited so they get Michael who has special hand cranked cameras to help. FYI: Interesting fact, Michael is the actor that accidentally killed Brandon Lee on the Crow movie set. There is a cameo by Donna Mills and the title has two meanings; one is the word they keep saying in bad situations and the other is an acronym.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'What an interesting movie. Half Arrival, half Dune, fully confusing. Yet hidden deep within this movie is a fascinating commentary about the hidden cycles of abuse and neglect in Hollywood, and the confronting truth of commercialising on disasters, risking everything for a spectacle, because its just what people do, with that storyline being deeply intertwined with Jude and Gordy\\'s storyline.How fascinating is it that the only reason Jude survived the attack was by focusing on the upstanding shoe, and in effect, acknowledging the true predator, Gordy, which none of the other humans could do? And similarly, OJ\\'s possible survival of the alien\\'s attack was through through the acknowledgement that he indeed, cannot face the predator, yet maybe he truly did die from the alien, and the final scene, surrounded in mist and fog, was a vision, which amplifies that idea even more, which really says something about power hierarchies in Hollywood and the world in general.\"Nope\" has some excellent visuals, and many crazy intense scenes on top of that. The false scares with the children in alien masks? Really suspenseful. The final 30 minutes of the film were gripping, and the lack of unnecessary dialogue, and the extended moments of silence with a thumping, gripping soundtrack, amplified Peels\\' intense direction.A great, and somewhat confusing first time watch, but once you let it sink in, the resounding themes hidden in this film do reveal themselves.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Ok. This is no 'Get Out'. This is not even on the same level. And that's not just because it isn't anywhere nearly as good, but also because it's a very different style of film in terms of story and genre. While the film had many good disturbing and scary/freaky moments that had me clenching intensely, I had some gripes.The film suffers unfortunately for its pacing. It's so SLOW, and takes WAY too long to get going. Once the story is set up and we have a goal established, the characters combine very nicely and we have a great traditional unique dynamic and story going. However it takes so long for any real action to take place you're left wondering what the film is actually about and where it's going. Once you begin to understand it however, you realise that this film holds some great value in offering unique and iconic ideas (all I'll say is your not so typical UFO story). Alien films for me have to give me that disturbing sense and this film really delivered on that. Jordan Peele also does a terrific job in creating suspense and freaky moments. However, he needs to get there a lot sooner!My second gripe is the backstory of 'Gordy' and the sitcom where the chimp kills everyone. For me, this background information literally held no relevance to the overarching story at all. It was like watching two films. It could have been interesting if it offered a reason as to why the young boy now adult alien feeder was doing what he was doing, however it fails to make this connection. In fact, it fails to make any connection at all to what the main storyline is. It feels very random and for me doesn't offer anything interesting other than a good excuse for Jordan Peele to include some violent action in a what is otherwise a long boring film?My third gripe is the sister character. I think due to the poor acting ability of the actor herself, her character just becomes very annoying very quickly. And in a lot of the film she speaks so fast her words become one long blurred sentence and you can't make out what she's saying and leaves the audience confused.My fourth and final gripe is the comedy elements that just have to take over near the end. Unfortunately, Jordan Peele's natural comedic sense start to seep in towards the end, with ridiculous over the top moments that just leave you dumbfounded at how stupid the characters are and the story loses any sense of seriousness or value. What starts off as a dark serious intense creepy atmospheric horror with so much potential soon becomes a goofy silly nonsensical comedy, and it really just ruins the feel of the movie as a whole. But, Peele can't help this. As I said, it's his natural instinct. It's a shame, but what he did well in 'Get Out' hasn't been replicated here.While this is a completely different film and can be appreciated as it's own thing, it still lacks some qualities that could have emphasised the experience of this movie so much more. Real shame.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I was surprised how much I liked this film. After seeing Peele's name be on so many mediocre products in the last few years (as a producer, mind you) my opinion on him was waning. I think he's incredibly funny, and Get Out was a solid film, albeit a crowd-pleaser. Nope is a more thoughtful, slower, and more interesting film than his debut.I've tried to explain what makes this film so good to multiple friends now, and truth is that it's very difficult. There's a lot of components, seemingly unrelated, and it can seem like a more bloated Stephen King novel at times. After seeing the film, it's rewarding to see how purposeful each scene was.However I don't blame some people for thinking it's wasted time. It's not entirely obvious at first, and does require patience from the viewer. I do think some people (Logan Paul and similar morons) will hate the film, probably because their jobs morally and ethically oppose the narrative.For the way it's filmed, the characters are all unique, and a bit odd. The two main characters do complement each other well. Some of the side characters can get a little bit over the top, but at least the film commits to it.A real strength is the way Peele attracts the viewer to different portions of the screen. A brawl that's inconsequential to the plot takes place in the background as our characters converse. The way the film makes you constantly searching the terrifying sky in broad daylight is fantastic.And the horror itself is a different sort. It's not creepy so much as incredibly disturbing. One sequence of genuine nightmare fuel in this film in particular will stick with me for ages.And the sound mixing is stellar, listen to this with headphones or surround sound if you get the chance.I haven't delved into spoilers because I do think it's worth going in as blind as possible. Don't even watch the trailers, the marketing did set up people for disappointment I feel. Thankfully, I watched them afterwards. If this is the calibre of work that Peele is going to be putting out, then I am very, very excited.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Yep.As soon as I noticed 2/3 of people yapping about how bad this movie was I knew it was going to be great...This is one of those cases where I literally can\\'t imagine not thinking this movie is good. Every single element of it is immaculate. The writing and acting alone is enough to carry the movie, but then on top of that you have breathtaking landscapes and cinematography, a very tasteful and dynamic use of music and sound editing (Corey Hart chopped and screwed, those original score cues, the sick ass Butthole Surfers, Jesus Lizard, and RATM tees, etc), disciplined pacing and storytelling structure, but most impressively, a strikingly original take on aliens/UFO\\'s - an insanely ambitious concept which is actually pulled off entirely well due to visual effects that all actually work, on top of everything else I\\'ve already praised.Daniel Kaluuya is such a legend - he\\'s always such a hard-ass and so likable at the same time - dude just has so much realness. Keke Palmer and Brandon Perea both made a fan out of me - they both killed it with their characters, providing fully organic and realistically humorous personalities. The movie already goes so hard based off of these 3 characters alone - everything else is a bonus.This is definitely Jordan Peele\\'s most focused, cohesive movie, and his closest to being a masterpiece. It is insanely original and manages to be as entertaining as most classic blockbusters in a very similar manner. On that note, the finale is the only part that felt a bit \"Hollywood\" to me - pretty traditional - but I wouldn\\'t call it a flaw, it just felt like the least innovative part. Regardless, wow, what a visual feast and whirlwind of intensity. This is a nearly flawless film, thrilling and intriguing all the way through - I can\\'t imagine how anyone would not enjoy it.P. S. I consider this a legendary new-school horror movie, something which is quite rare in American cinema these days. This is what great horror is! Movies like this and Midsommar! Recognize!'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"Get Out\" took the world by storm when Jordan Peele seemingly out of nowhere made this horror / comedy sub-genre gain a huge popularity among audiences and critics, so it\\'s only natural that we would stay on the lookout for his next projects and so far I have to say I might stop doing that..I won\\'t get into too much detail but his next movie \"Us\" was a complete mess and now \"Nope\" while not a mess is just a basic story told in an odd way.. These days trailers give much of the plot away so the UFO aspect of the movie is known before hand and sure they explore themes of desensitizing people for the sake of \"blood\" and the lengths humans go to gain some notoriety and power but I didn\\'t feel the plot sent this message the best way, at least for me.The tone of the movie is odd and the main characters react to the shocking events in vary different ways, meaning some of them react legitimately scarred as a normal person would, others react just fine as if it was another day in the park - it seems the movie struggles with the balance between giving it some realism while trying to add the known dark comedy Peele usually portrays.I didn\\'t feel any connection to the characters at all, of course the actors do a good job but I mean that\\'s not enough, and the UFO serves exclusively as the mechanism to send the message the movie wants to send, there\\'s no possible backstory, explanation why is it there, what it actually is... adding all of this to the fact that a long portion of the movie moves very slowly with too much building up that ultimately leads nowhere, makes this a flop.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Conceptually and visually compelling, the next installment in Jordan Pele\\'s growing Arsenal \\'Nope\" is both dissapointing and unique at the same time. Here\\'s the gist, if you\\'re entering this movie expecting to be mind blown by heavy handed subtle themes that we saw in previous Pele films and new logistics in the Sci-Fi genre then prepare to be dissapointed. Nope changes our cliched perception and superstitions on UFOs and how they always appeared to us as aliens into something abit more realistic and savage. The thematic level of the movie lets the audience brainstorm inorder to connect certain things and themes so it is fairly complex, but not as strong or hard hitting. The movie focuses on the grief of our two main characters which I found one of the good things about the movie, but never really takes it to its end or establishes a well-coherent character study like \"Get out\" or \"Us\", it\\'s evident that Pele doesn\\'t want to restrict his movie to one thing as he wants to try alot of different things and ideas in this movie which is really creative but never actually pays off any of the ideas he is playing with or fully explore them, there is really only one idea which I found worked which is how we as humans are always concious about organisms that inhabit our world as if it only belongs to us alone, and are more concerned with fame than with integrity and safety and staying away from the strange and unknown. The movie excels in creativity but I still found the movie overly long and slow paced, even in action sequences when things start happening, it sometimes feels confusing when the camera just stops for stairing at certain scenes, Pele runs out of ideas specially in the third act as I found the intonation of the resolution, solution and ending dissapointing. However, the spectacle was awe-inspiring, Pele gets you up and close with that thing whenever he wants to and shows you what he wants you to see in specific times.A movie that can leave you at times diasappointed and questioning the intentions of its creator but nonetheless never a bad or a too good of a movie, admirable for its originality but alot more was needed to be done to make this feature on the other levels of Peele\\'s previous artforms and for Pele\\'s target audience who prefer abit more thought provoking themes over spectacle that is brilliant visually but at times disappointing creatively and intellectualy.'},\n",

A very interesting mystery is put forth that builds slowly and ramps up in a tense and satisfying way. I had lots of fun during the thrilling moments in the film, especially in theaters. As with his other two films, the thematic undertones are just as cerebral and interesting to ponder leaving the film and every scene shown makes sense in retrospect even if it leaves you a little confused in the moment. Peele also continues injecting just enough humor to keep you laughing without compromising the integrity of the serious situation unfolding. The characters are all interesting and entertaining though Keke Palmer definitely stands out here as the shining star. Overall, great thriller and another solid entry in Peele's repertoire.

It sucks people in, chews them alive, and spits out the remains, and its eye or mouth - or whatever that hole is - is the eye of the camera. I have no idea if that is what they had in mind with the movie or it\\'s just fans clutching for straws.But my God, it is horrible either way. The \"horror\" scenes are literally histerical. The alien just looks like some OG Star Trek attempt at a costume, and when it sucks people to eat them it just looks like they\\'re lying under a blanket trying to look scared instead of cozy... And then when it flies above and you head the screams sound like you\\'re standing under a rollercoaster, I mean frankly, it\\'s hilarious. If that was on purpose or not, it doesn\\'t matter, it\\'s just comically bad. There is a scene where the \"monster\" chews the people it ate and then goes to toilet right above the protagonists\\' house, with bits and pieces falling on the roof, and how the script that involves a man dying by being hit on the head by alien poop isn\\'t one of them, I\\'ll never know. Or the ending where the monster is beaten by chewing on a balloon that pops and makes the monster literally explode. Is Hollywood a balloon waiting to pop? Ah, we\\'ll never know.But the worst offenders are the main characters - the sister is obnoxious and acted massively over the top, while the brother just has one facial expression and one emotion, and neither of them are fun. The pacing is at the speed of an indecisive-moving glacier, the first 40 minutes of the movie are one big drawn-out nothing. Finally, the plot is one big gaping hole, and the subplots - the one with the bad chimpanzee CGI especially - are boring and add nothing to the movie. How people can see an alien life form that eats people alive right in front of them and not call the police or get out of there but instead try to record it for... Ah, right, that\\'s the supposed message and the deeper meaning of the movie, don\\'t get eaten alive by the fame you\\'re trying to achieve.But maybe the people who made this mess should have made a decent movie. Maybe if your message is that people shouldn\\'t do stupid things in order to get rich and famous, you shouldn\\'t do stupid things trying to get that message across... Especially if you\\'re already rich and famous and you\\'re trying to get more of both. As I said, this movie is hilarious in that it\\'s actually part of the problem it\\'s trying to warn us about, but doesn\\'t realize it at all.'},\n",

While the second half is dominated by exciting action, as we finally see the alien entity in full bloom launching its ruthless attacks. The photography is beautiful, there's some fine humor to counter-balance all the scary going-ons, and the acting of the (small) cast is top notch. The CGI is absolutely great, with an impressively designed alien monster. And maybe the ultimate scene of the movie isn't really credible, but after all the turmoil and excitement it brings a very welcome, even moving relief.If anything to nitpick about, it would be the flashbacks of the attack of chimp Gordy: absolutely blood-chilling to see, but I'm not sure how this should be interpreted in reference to the main story.

But at the same time, in comparison to many other movies by other directors then \"Nope\" wasn\\'t a particularly outstanding or entertaining movie.The storyline was interesting enough, however, running at 130 minutes the movie was prolonged and could have benefitted tremendously with a more efficient hand in the editing room, because there were many long instances in the movie where nothing happened and it felt like it was pure filler on the screen. However, I will say that the concept idea behind the movie was definitely interesting enough.The acting performances in the movie were good, and it was definitely nice to see the likes of Michael Wincott, Keith David and Steven Yeun on the screen, despite it being in smaller supportive roles.Visually then \"Nope\" was good. The CGI looked real and the special effects were used in a great way to enhance the mystery in the movie.However, while \"Nope\" was the best of Jordan Peele\\'s movies, then this is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"So, after seeing Trailers of this & being quite curious since first hearing about it back in 2021, I finally got to watch this filmThe Film sees 2 siblings running a Horse Ranch in California discover something Sinister in the skies that terrorises them & their Ranch. Meanwhile, the owner of an adjacent Theme Park tries to profit from the mysterious, otherworldly phenomenon. A Hardware Store Owner & a Filmmaker club together with the Siblings to stop this UFO's Sinister Rain of terror.I found the film to be pretty out there... & of course, not in a good way. Words can't describe this film. A part of me thinks it wasn't as bad as I thought & that it had some great visuals & scenes in it. But... another part of me thinks this film (like others of its caliber) is heavily overrated & didn't find the film to be all that great after viewing.Given it's story, which is pretty simple, it had a pretty poor narrative. Not to mention poor & slow pacing with a 2 hour & 4 minute runtime. A good 40 minutes could've been exercised from this film & the narrative could've been far more clear, like what was this UFO & how did the Siblings & others know how to stop it never mind if it would work in the first place etc.The way the film was structured with chapters was annoying & there was a lot of scenes like the one with the monkey on the TV Set, that felt out of place & didn't seem to have any relevance to what the main films story was about. Like I said, the film could've been heavily cut down to a 1 hour & 30 minute runtime.The visuals were great as with the sinister feel going on. There's some gore here & there & some pretty bizarre & not too bad visuals, though the UFO bit at the end just got really dumb & beyond believability. The end part with the woman saving the day was typical & eye rolling as, not to mention the ending itself which while it looked good was just very anti climatic given the sluggish pacing & story leading to the climax.Overall, it's an overrated sluggish, overly long, UFO Horror with out of place scenes & a poor narrative. While there's some good things to be had, with visuals some gore & sinister things going on, it's one of those films that doesn't cut it.4/10.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I was ready to be a bit harsher on Jordan Peele than usual with this film. Get Out (2017) was a formidable debut, but while I enjoyed the atmosphere of his next film, Us (2019), I was thinking it may be time to start tweaking the scripts so that the dialogue is a bit less on-the-nose and the supernatural elements aren\\'t over-explained. That way, we won\\'t scratch our heads about the logistics of their in-universe existence and they will also work better as metaphors for the systemic forces of our society (on account of being more interpretable and abstract).With Nope, Peele\\'s knack for atmosphere is once again the best thing about it, but I would say the dialogue feels a bit more natural here than with Us and the themes are handled more gracefully. It is no surprise that Close Encounters and Signs served as blueprints for the film, but this is certainly more terrifying -- and respectable -- than anything Shyamalan has made of late.Even if you don\\'t catch the subtext (what the ominous sights are meant to represent) or even pay much attention to the more overt social commentary, the images of lights and movement beyond the clouds tap into the fear we all share of the unknown, but also our fascination toward it. It\\'s wildly effective in its eeriness; this is what Peele excels at. But indeed, also par for the course is the theme of Black History -- and the erasure of it.Early on, Peele takes a moment to inform us of other black Americans\\' contributions to cinema. According to some, the first motion picture ever created is 1888\\'s The Roundhay Garden Scene (which is true in the sense that it constitutes the first known usage of a proper film camera). According to the phenomenal documentary All Light, Everywhere (2021), it\\'s Pierre Jules César Janssen\\'s 1874 depiction of Venus passing the sun. Nope argues that, depending on how you define \"movie\", the first ever is Eadweard Muybridge\\'s 1878 sequence of a black gentleman on a horse -- the earliest true example of film\\'s immediate precursor \"chronophotography\", which in turn was inspired by Janssen\\'s revolver experiments. (Phenakistiscopes predate both of these by several decades, but let\\'s not be like that).Either way, Nope follows the descendants of the man who rode the horse -- whose name has been lost to history (unlike that of Muybridge), though the film tells us he was named Haywood. Now working at a Hollywood horse ranch, Otis \"OJ\" Haywood Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya, terrific as usual) and Emerald \"Em\" Haywood (Keke Palmer) join up with a film crew and others to get the shot of a lifetime when their father (Keith David) is seemingly killed by extraterrestrial forces. Horror, food for thought, and a bit of comedy ensue, plus loving homages to all the classics I\\'ve already mentioned, but also Neon Genesis Evangelion, which I certainly did not expect.The supporting cast -- consisting of Steven Yeun, Michael Wincott, and relative newcomer Brandon Parea -- does a seminal job and supplies believable but sometimes appropriately eccentric characters. The music, framing, and ambiance do wonders; even the scenes in broad daylight succeed at being scary. And of course, the script displays a knack for plotting and reincorporation. When modern cameras begin to malfunction in the presence of the alien threat, an ancient hand-cranked one must be used.While Nope loses some steam near the end, there is no doubt that Jordan Peele is getting better and better. We understand what the images mean and there\\'s never any in-universe over-explaining of them to distract/confuse us, as I initially expected. Even when they do touch on what these weird creatures \"literally\" are, it can be interpreted in ways that bolster the themes of systematic oppression, our addiction to spectacle, and the way we cling to beliefs in the divine -- which is to say nothing of the witty use of movie-camera motifs, e.g. The shutter-like eye of the entity.Something I also expected was cartoonishly evil white people, whose depiction would surely go over well with the Instagram generation (who may even deem it realistic) but might not gel with how real the other characters feel. However, as comical as the racist characters are, they never seem one-dimensional, or like they\\'re meant to appease those who claim not to see color yet operate (and read history) as though they actually observe two colors: \"person of color\" and \"racist\"; good and bad. (Au contraire, one of the worst offenders in the picture is a Hispanic gentleman.) I foresaw a pea-brained approach when I spoke about this film in my review of A24\\'s Men (which is deeper than \"all men are bad\", even if not all of its haters, or fans, will concede to it) and I\\'m not sure why I thought that. Peele is hardly as unwise as some of his fans would like to think; many on Twitter reduce Peele\\'s societal analysis to \"white people are evil\" and laud him for it.There are a few moments where the horror risks being deflated by comedy (another problem I had more so with Us but let slide in Get Out). Of course, Peele\\'s beginnings are with Mad TV and so it makes sense that his movies would be comedies on some level. (There\\'s even a MAD Magazine shout-out). There is one thing I cannot decide. Is it more tactfully done here than in Us, or is it just easier to accept that the film won\\'t be wholly serious when the title is Nope?Going back to Shyamalan again, I will say that Peele is not as funny on purpose as Shyamalan was unintentionally with last year\\'s Old, though I trust you all know which is the better film.'},\n",

People are rating this movie solely on the hidden messages in this movie and not in it's entirety which is confusing many of us who purely want to watch a movie, not for politics and artistic efforts.I do enjoy Jordan Peele movies, well, I did enjoy Get Out and Us. Nope however, it wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't great. If great means basing 130 minutes of film on making digs at Hollywood and not based on the entirety of a story then I have to rate this as just about average and somewhat bizarre to watch. At times I felt like I was watching a giant Mexican hat glide across my screen for what felt like an eternity. I agree with the message but that didn't make 2 hours and 10 minutes groundbreaking cinema.If you want to praise the messages in the movie about how toxic Hollywood is in many ways, how greed and disregard for any human life including animals for the sake of money, then praise the message. But as a movie it was incredibly drawn out, over long, at times boring and ridiculous. To me the film as a whole was far from a masterpiece as so many have shouted.If you're expecting anything on the same level and quality of Peele's previous movies, like me, you'll be disappointed. This was a bizarre complicated mess and could of portrayed it's messages in a slightly different way. Honestly, I spent over an hour incredibly bored.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"For once, I'm complaining that a 2-hour movie is too short.This movie, clearly Peele's weakest outing to date, is still good, but felt wildly underdeveloped. The characters are super deep to begin with and when the focus leaves them and straight into the Eye of the storm, I was left with wanting more.Nope revolves around an extraordinary entity above the ranch of siblings left to somewhat run the place after the sudden passing of the owner. And this entity is not concerned with the longevity of the ranch's new owners or town.I'll go on record and state I liked this movie including its performances and attention to detail which were both amazing. Peele's still great as a director and I'd love to learn about all the Easter Eggs I failed to catch, though I felt I got a ton of them. That all said, for every positive, I found something to drag the film down.For the most part, it's boring. It takes a LONG TIME to get going. Luckily, however, Peele does keep us entertained by getting to know the town, townsfolk and incredible chemistry between the lead Brother and Sister. But, once the threat kicks in, the movie switches into high-gear and actions of the heroes to combat their adversary is rather unbelievable.Plus, the third act is much too short. Some might get way more out of this than I did, but this climax mirrored 2021's Candyman's fast-forwarded ending.While it didn't feel like two hours had passed, it felt like it hadn't really had a chance to resolve the many, many, many subplots, issues and directions this began and fizzled out. I could've seen an entire movie on Subplot 4: the Chimp & the forever gorgeous Steven Yeun.It's worth a second viewing, though certainly not until it's available for streaming on one of the platforms I already pay for. Won't rush to see it again, because it's nowhere near as deep or thought-provoking as Peele's Us or Get Out. Nope, this is as straight-forward as they come, despite all the extra fluff.***Final Thoughts: I'm still stuck on the Chimp in Subplot 4. Weird. I spend the greater part of 2+ hours trying to get the smallest pieces of the overall puzzle only to be really drawn to Subplot 4 and its enormously weird actions of its characters. See? THAT I'd like to have seen more of than the actual main idea.\"},\n",

Steven Yeun\\'s character, who I assume also speaks for director Jordan Peele here, says he will show the audience a \"spectacle\". And he does show the audience, both in the film and us watching, a spectacle or horror. And it is one of the scariest things I\\'ve witnessed because of how (ironically) grounded the performances are. The shrieks and screams of people experiencing this spectacle don\\'t simply feel scared, they feel TERRIFIED. AGONIZED. CHAOTIC. CONFUSED. IN HORRIFIC PAIN AND TERROR. Jordan Peele knows how to tether (heh..) his films to reality.People criticize how there aren\\'t as many scares as they expected, but while that might be true that the horror is as sparse as the land it\\'s filmed on, each scare means something. Each one primes the audience to think a certain way about the aliens. What do they look like? When will we see them emerge from their flying saucer? What will they do when we see them? And midway through, without revealing too much, we realize too late with the rest of the audience that our idea of these aliens are way, way off...The performances by everyone are great. I wish I were out battling this UFO with them. My only complaint is that despite the ordeal they\\'ve just been through, they don\\'t seem to change much as characters by the end. This also makes the movie feel a little longer than it should be.\"Nope\" could be about half an hour to an hour shorter... but boy, does Jordan Peele know how to toy with your suspense levels, and expectations.'},\n",

Not JUST THAT though,.... creature that was apparently attempting to be tamed.This whole concept was just mind numbing.

My family and I decided to watch it together (we all love horror movies) and we're able to enjoy movies like fall, with less of a horror aspect and more of tension, with low ratings but.. no. This isn't it. The movie has a total of 2 interesting scenes and the monsters (or aliens) are hinted at and yet never shown despite the movie practically leading up to their appearance for most of it. In a lot of movies, that's okay, but with 2 interesting scenes you get a UFO party and some children playing hide and seek. This movie goes on for 1 hour way too long.\"},\n",

Instead of a mostly white cast, Mr. Peele opted for a mostly African cast, no surprises there.

So far the best Jordan Peele film is \"Get Out\" which is, in my honest opinion, his most original and gripping film to date. I thought \"Us\" was kinda stupid and \"Nope\" not really original in any sense. I suppose the use of those wobbly air socks was a great use of color contrast, but it didn\\'t make the movies great.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I think that the director felt like he had a masterful blockbuster on his hands when he made this film. The way each chapter is introduced, the way there are scenes early on that are not explained until halfway through the film. The way there's time leaps with no apparent trigger for them.I think the hope was that this would be a masterful thriller along the lines of Pulp Fiction.However. The characters were badly formed or not formed at all. The dialogue was similar to the strained conversations of surly teens. And the acting. Well let me tell you about the acting. There has been better acting in 70's B movies.I've never been a fab of Daniel Kaluuya, I don't think he can act at all. And yet here he is the male lead. In my opinion Keke Palmer and Brandon Perea play better parts.However the main struggle is in the storyline.Not much is explained, so we never know why power starts and stops. We never know why some scenes appear which have no link to the story. Why, when the main stars have apparently just avoided being eaten by a ravished alien, spending the entire night in fear, they escape and start...playing video games.Cut scenes come in and out of play without reason or explanation.There's absolutely no flow to the story it's just a jumbled collection of badly acted, meaningless scenes, all carried out to the same slow pace throughout. It's a little over 2 hours long and feels like 3 times that. I switched off at 1hr 25 minutes when I realised it really wasn't going to get any better.I did rate it 3 but one of those stars was for the fabulous scenery that I never get tired of seeing.\"},\n",

I'll admit to being a little disappointed when I saw his third film was going to be UFO/alien based. Not just because that isn't a subject I typically enjoy, but also because it felt like it was going to be less personal than the what made the first two so great.That was basically how the actual film ended up being for me. I still throughly enjoyed it, but it wasn't on the same level as his first two films. It felt more like a spectacle film, than a powerful metaphor with dark and twisted character interactions which I wanted. This one felt like it was designed to entertain first and foremost. It's still a very clever film but that isn't as apparent this time around.The characters didn't work for me this time around. They were too cookie-cutter. So much care and effort went into his characters in the first two films, yet this time around they were as bland and forgettable as you'd ever get. That was the biggest disappointment out of the film for me. The love and attention to building them up and making us care for them wasn't there.This probably sounds like a very negative review when it isn't intended to be. I just like to think I hold Peele to very high standards because I know the incredible work he's capable of. This one wasn't bad, it just wasn't necessarily what I wanted. 7/10.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Right from the opening shot, my eyes were glued to the screen while watching Jordan Peele\\'s new film, \"Nope\". I fell in love with this movie before I had even finished watching it, the film blew me away! \"Nope\" is a sheer cinematic spectacle to behold, the likes of which we rarely get from blockbusters these days. I was stunned by it, and have found myself unable to stop thinking about it since seeing the film. \"Nope\" is very different from Jordan Peele\\'s other films, \"Get Out\" (which I love) and \"Us\" (which I like), and while this may be a \"hot take\", I think this is Peele\\'s best film to date! It\\'s a masterpiece of a film that was right up my alley, easily my favourite of his! It\\'s so clever, so terrifying, chilling, creative and even funny! The film has a lot of interesting surprises in store with a plot that was so fulfilling and satisfying that had a lot of thematic intellect while also being an incredible, and most importantly, completely original sci-fi thriller!I must echo the statements of other reviewers: Peele combines so many director\\'s styles in this film, it feels Hitchcockian mixed with Spielberg, with hints of Tarantino, Kubrick and even Carpenter. It\\'s so exciting to see Peele be able to craft films on the level of these other directors, and I can fully say that he has his own style that he has developed over his three films that takes elements from all these great directors. Peele\\'s greatest skill in my opinion is his natural ability to craft tense scenes and build tension so masterfully. He has this instinct on how to manufacture and elicit emotional responses that he wants to get out of you as an audience, and this film truly showed off a phenomenal use of tension and suspense, some of the best I\\'ve ever seen in recent years! I especially loved how he used the blow up air dancers to create such strong suspense and tension near the end! Peele\\'s direction is something truly special, his storytelling abilities are my favourite aspect of this film. You\\'re invested in the story the whole way through, and reveals are executed so perfectly. The film has a fantastic build up to the climax, and has some excellent pay-offs... everything comes full circle! I love the way Peele is able to blend and bend genres, as this film mixes horror, sci-fi, and even comedy (he makes use of the title in some clever ways) so expertly. And of course, as shown with his previous films, he layers thematics into the story perfectly!The film itself is a spectacle, but also very cleverly explores themes around spectacle, from the lengths we go to in order to create and receive it, to how we can turn tragic events into spectacle, essentially the idea of exploitation for entertainment. Peele examines how we have this inner need to be the spectacle and event connects this to the current state of the film industry. It\\'s no secret this is a UFO film, and I loved the way Peele opens the movie focusing on horses and chimps, but ends it with an alien plot, using it to further the point that in order to achieve spectacle you have to keep doing more and more. There\\'s a scene early on involving a commercial shoot, where a live horse gets replaced with a CGI one because it is perceived as \"better\". I really liked this commentary on what the film industry is currently doing to achieve spectacle in films, as we really are moving from live actors and animals and settings, to more CGI based ones to create an even bigger spectacle.The film also has some cool references to film history, including showing one of the first things ever put to film, Muybridge\\'s shot of a black man on a horse, and I loved the way Peele replicated this near the climax of the movie with a modern film sensibility, showing how far film has come while also commenting on what used to be exciting (a man riding a horse) to what is exciting now (a man on a horse riding away from a UFO). I just really ate up the thematics of this film, it worked so well for me and was so well placed in the film. Hell, you could write a thesis on it. There was also an element that seemed to be about film crews, how sometimes people involved in monumental achievements in film are not recognized, and I thought this worked very well too! Now, a lot of people seem to be upset about the sequences involving the monkey, saying they aren\\'t relevant to the plot. I would argue against this, that while plot-wise they may not fit perfectly, they are necessary thematically to set up the idea of how we abuse and exploit animals for our entertainment, and the overall theme of the movie of how we can turn tragic events into spectacle and money making opportunities. I thought it worked perfectly thematically and ensured the audience understood what Peele was trying to do with the finale of the film.While I did write a lot about the thematics this film covers, I won\\'t say anything about the plot past what I have. This is a film you want to experience for yourself and not have any idea about what surprises may be in store. And trust me, there are some excellent ones that were so brilliant and unexpected. Peele does something I have never seen in a UFO film before and I loved it, especially the feeling of realization as I figured it out! It has such a good mystery to it and clever reveals that subtly let you piece them together yourself without outright telling you. The film is different, and weird, and unlike anything else I\\'ve seen before, it\\'s a wholly original blockbuster from Peele, and that is truly rare in this day and age, so it must be appreciated!Earlier I said there were Spielbergian elements to this film, and quite honestly it does remind me of one of Spielberg\\'s most famous films. Not \"Close Encounters\" as one might think, but instead \"Jaws\". This is 100% Jordan Peele\\'s \"Jaws\". It uses suspense in many of the same ways, and instead of a shark in the sea... we have a UFO in the sky. \"Jaws\" was famous for making people not want to go in the water... but \"Nope\" will have you terrified to look up at the sky! I even loved how Peele did seem to compare the sky to the ocean, as both really are very unknown. This movie truly is as effective a horror/thriller summer blockbuster as \"Jaws\" was... it is on the level of that film! And yet, it feels more like what would have happened if Hitchcock directed \"Jaws\", it\\'s just this really interesting style of suspense that I loved so much!From a technical standpoint this movie is flawless. Peele has Nolan-esque visuals here, probably because he hired Nolan\\'s current cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema. The film just looked gorgeous and had you looking all around the screen! I\\'ve also never seen nighttime scenes look this beautiful! It really showed off the sky brilliantly too, and made me really want to study the clouds in the frame. I haven\\'t seen a film featuring the sky this prominently in awhile, and the shots used are perfect! Hell, the visual effects were even fascinating! The film also demands to be seen in IMAX, the format it was shot for, as not only does it look great on those screens (and you get the expanded aspect ratio), but it also sounds incredible. The sound mix here is a beast, and the sound design was absolutely terrifying. It worked so well to create the suspense and feelings of dread! I even loved what they did with the soundtrack, from the fantastic score with notes of Western style, to the mix they did for \"Sunglasses at Night\" which was so chilling.And how could I not talk about the cast? They were incredible! Keke Palmer had so much energy and was just so much fun to watch, but I really loved Daniel Kaluuya as the more stoic hero... felt like a very lone gunslinger type. He communicated so much to the audience in so little words, it was such a skilled performance. Their performances also matched so well, you could feel their sibling-like chemistry! Brandon Perea\\'s character was also such a surprise too, he was easily my favourite! I wish Steven Yeun was in it a little bit more, but I loved what he did with the time he had.Nope absolutely stunned me! It\\'s so refreshing to see a big, well made, wholly original blockbuster oozing with style and tension. The movie probably won\\'t be for everyone, but at least for me I thought it was truly awesome. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time, my hands clutching the seat rest, I had such a good time watching it! And since watching it, I can\\'t stop thinking about the themes it explored and all the deeper meanings behind the thrilling set pieces. Jordan Peele is truly a talented director, and if you are a fan of film you have to see this on the biggest screen possible and experience it for yourself! I can\\'t wait to see what Jordan Peele has in store for us next, as I loved the spectacle, thrills and thematic content he brought us with \"NOPE\".'},\n",

Her brother OJ seems to be on a mixture of different kind of drugs through the movie. He simply does noy make any connection with the audience and just stares into the abyss for more than 2 hours. Visual effects are nice and the story is also interesting. But it just falls short for me. It's not horror, definitely not scary. There not a lot going on really except for the final half an hour. It never blew me away, surprised me, made me laugh or scared me. It's just a big nope for me.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Nope is Jordan Peele\\'s latest masterpiece, a genre-bending mashup of horror, sci-fi, western and comedy. It succeeds where the \"Cowboys and Alien\\'s\" failed. The film follows OJ and Jupe, two childhood friends who grew up in Hollywood as actors of color. OJ is a black man who starred in a series of alien invasion movies in the 90s, while Jupe is an Asian American woman who played a sidekick role in a sitcom with a chimpanzee. They reunite after decades of estrangement to attend the premiere of a documentary about their careers, but soon find themselves in the middle of a real alien invasion that threatens to destroy Los Angeles.The film is a clever commentary on the history and representation of race and ethnicity in Hollywood, as well as the modern obsession with fame and social media. Peele contrasts the invisibility and marginalization of OJ and Jupe in their past roles (along with minorities in film in genera) with the current need to see and be scene constantly. Peele also explores the different ways they cope with their trauma and identity, as OJ embraces his heroic persona (literally riding off into the sunset, cowboy hat cocked just so) while Jupe struggles with her self-esteem and resentment. The film also pays homage to classic films and TV shows that influenced Peele, such as the 80\\'s interracial sitcom, The Thing, The Magnificent Seven, Planet of the Apes and Saturday Night Live.Nope is not as straightforward or shocking as Peele\\'s previous films, but it is more nuanced and ambitious. It challenges the audience to think critically about the messages and images they consume, and how they shape their perception of reality. It also delivers a thrilling and entertaining ride, with stunning visuals, witty dialogue and terrifying creatures. Nope is a rare example of a film that succeeds in blending multiple genres and themes without losing its coherence or impact.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"So many reviews trashing this because it's not like his previous movies. But honestly, I think his previous are overrated, Get Out, his greatest movie fans say, was hyped up to be one of the best horror movies, but Peele as a director has a tendency to compromise the potential to get a message through, instead of working it into the movie properly, at least that's what I saw with Get Out.It had a good horror premise, but it's absolutely wasted and I've seen him repeat that in the Twilight Zone show, meanwhile there are better horror-like episodes in Key & Peele.Now he doesn't do that here, it all works, but of course those who have fallen for his style in Get Out will not get what they've come to expect here, because Peele is showing he can do more, just like he did on the show.Daniel's acting shows he can do more too, I didn't like what Keke was doing, considering where it takes place and her character's presumed upbringing, she felt out of place, there could be untold reasons for this though but her character gets a little annoying.All other characters are well acted and the extra story about the chimpanzee was great and really adds to the animal treatment narrative the movie has.The alien(s) are very inventive and suitably horrifying.The movie overall kind of reminds me of Alien, they're not that far apart, one of my favorite things they both do, which I saw a review here complain a bit about, is that the movie doesn't answer questions the characters wouldn't know the answer too, the viewer will have to think of it themselves.However, I'm not sure the ending was entirely fitting, but the road there was very enjoyable and has awoken my interest in seeing more of Peele's work.\"},\n",

It was such an incredibly self-indulgent project where subjects or events that were clearly on interest to Jordan Peele were just shoe-horned into the plot regardless of whether they fitted or not.For instance we kept coming back to the ape going ape scene , this was clearly allegorical on several levels but few around me would have got this as it made little sense.What narrative there was largely unintelligible, a mix of American street jive and midwestern guttural. Luckily we didn't need to understand. Emerald Haywood, played by Keke Palmer overdid the zany and frenetic and seemed to employed only two faces throughout, OJ Haywood played by Daniel Kaluuya, was excellent, from the school of minimalism, conveyed everything with a grunt of a glance. Angel Tores was also great who played the tech geek.It was a suspense thriller rather than a horror and the CGI was really very inventive.I'm going to give this a firm 6 outta 10, it was a great night out even though much of it didn't make much sense.\"},\n",

Their investigation will draw in their neighbor, former child star Ricky \"Jupe\" Park (Steven Yeun, THE WALKING DEAD), a tech from the local IT Hardware store, Angel Torres (Brandon Perea, THE OA) and a wildlife cinematographer, Antlers Holst, who specializes in getting the \"impossible\" shot (Michael Wincott, THE CROW).It\\'s a wildly entertaining, grip-your-armchair type of film that unfolds on the screen in clever ways (without getting \"too\" weird) - all with the pragmatic sensibilities of Peele, the former member of the comedy duo KEYE & PEELE. Jordan has grown into a filmmaker that must not be missed and in NOPE he showcases his skill with strong effect, being in complete control of the artistic point of view while delivering a highly entertaining thriller.Of course, it helps that you have a performer as interesting to watch as Kaluuya - one of the finest performers in film today. He plays the taciturn OJ with complete \"taciturn-ness\" (if that is a word) and, in his skilled body, this performance works very, very well. He says more with a glance or a shrug than most people can say with a 1,000 words and he draws you into the screen and into his thoughts with tremendous intimacy.Keke Palmer, by contrast, is the exact opposite. Her Emerald is flamboyant, chatty, up-beat and beset by inner demons made manifest by drugs, alcohol and smoke. It is a movie-saving performance by Palmer as she brings the heart and the energy to the proceedings while Kaluuya is the quiet brains and the soul.Perea, Yeun, David and (especially) Wincott all add to the tapestry of the events and bring something interesting and worth looking at (and into) during the course of this film.Peele ratchets the tension throughout this film like an expert and the Special Effects are used in exactly the right way that they needed to be used and showcased throughout the film - filling you with awe when that is called for and having you think to yourself \"you\\'ve got to be kidding me\" when that is exactly what the characters are thinking.A masterful, original concept of a film by Peele - one that is not for everyone - but those that are into this type of thing are going to be in for a unique and original film filled with unique characters and more than one jump along the way.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)'},\n",

That's the conceit behind Jordan Peele's latest, Nope, which aims to outline the circumstances that might allow the dream of first contact to coexist with the reality of such a closely-observed world.Set in the vast desert isolation just beyond Los Angeles, Nope draws great dramatic tension from the smothering, lonely stillness of the ranch. Alongside a small cast, we witness strange, recurring phenomena and feel the hair on our arms rise. At its best when toying with the same brand of subtle eeriness found in Signs and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, it leaves plenty to the imagination while still showing us more than we might have expected. There's some loose meta commentary here, too - I'd expect as much from Peele - but it's less overt and essential than it was in Get Out. That shift may have been a mistake. Though the 2022 model boasts potent ambiance and a knack for well-timed suspense, I found the meat of the story to be rather lean. It's creepy, it's moody, it's visually powerful. That's really where it all begins and ends.\"},\n",

It\\'s longer than it needs to be, sorta confusing and underwhelming.The first act is supposed to be an introduction to our characters and setting up the story but the characters didn\\'t give much of a reason to become invested and the story seemed to be going in too many different directions.

To get \"the Oprah shot\": footage so incredible, it will get them onto her show.While I disagree with those saying that Jordan Peele is getting progressively worse, I do think that with this one, he struggles to tie together the various immensely interesting ideas he has and is unable to explore all of them, because there are so many, though they do all complement each other. As a director, he continues to grow, challenge himself and rise to the occasion. However, for his screenplays, I think he may need, if not a co-writer, someone willing to be brutally honest providing notes.He continues to know exactly when to subvert genre expectations(if he did it all the time, it would become full parody, and that would work, sure, still, it is not what he\\'s looking to do) and when to play them straight(if he always did it, it would be predictable). This is easily the best filmed of the three. The characters are psychologically credible, memorable and compelling. I am not exaggerating when I say that I would be happy to watch an entire series of movies just about these people going about their lives. You really get the sense that this brother and sister grew up together, and there\\'s a lot of love as well as tension. Daniel Kaluuya has played withdrawn before, yes, but it is impressive how he can make OJ(!) in this, and Chris in Get Out, completely different, yet both authentic.This features a ton of gory violence(sometimes graphic, very frequently inferred or discussed), and a lot of strong language. I recommend this to any fan of the man behind it. 8/10.'},\n",

With hits he had a good comedy show in Key and Peele (2012) that unfortunately did overplay most jokes by just repeating points in the skits. But many skits are still funny even though they are too long. Then he went into horror with Get Out (2017) with the same lead actor as in Nope and his plan was to make a movie where all White people are evil. It was a smash hit and one of the best horror movies ever. But before and after his comedy skit show he wrote a lot and nearly everything is bad to mediocre. The remake of The Twilight Zone is said to be too political and bad. Peele is known for being quite progressive politically. The Candyman remake is also supposedly all about race to a degree where it becomes bad because it gets too banal. He only writes movies about Blackness and most are just plain bad because he only has this one worldview and in 9 out of 10 tries it comes out as a failure to understand society or race because it is so ignorant of all other points of view. This is what happened to Us (2019). The movie he made after Get Out (2017) that was supposed to make him one of the best directors. Hell, even after only 1 movie people were calling him an iconic director and one of the best ever. In 2017 I saw plenty of \"top 10 best directors ever\" lists with Peele at the top. After the huge miss in Us with the overly confusing storytelling many felt Get Out was a one hit wonder. And with all his projects after 2017 failing, until Nope in 2022, it seemed like he wasn\\'t talented.After watching Nope I feel like Jordan Peele is fine enough when he tries his best. The acting is good, the storytelling is decent, camera work is still good, and he still is splashed with cash to make his big budget movies. It kinda works. It\\'s not a great movie, but it is watchable unlike Us. But like in Us the story and character choices make no sense.We follow a sister and brother who are at a farm for raising horses. They sell horses to a local Wild West theme park that uses them to feed a UFO in the sky that\\'s actually a wild animal. The theme park owner feeds the alien horses at a specific time each week. This time he invites 40 people to watch the show. The alien arrives early and eats them all. Meanwhile the brother and sister are trying to film the alien to get on Oprah. But all electronics go out as the alien comes by so they invite a photographer with analog film to record it. But when they are done filming the camera guy goes fully insane and suicides by getting eaten by the alien as he feels they don\\'t deserve these recordings.Frankly, while much of it makes some sense, a ton of it is forced storytelling. The brother finds out that the alien only eats you if it sees your eyes. Yet we never clearly understand how he figured it out. He just says it and is 100% sure of it all of a sudden and his sister and a friend 100% believe him right away without even testing the claim carefully. He doesn\\'t even need to tell them how he figured it out to convince them. Keep in mind if he is wrong they will likely all die as there is no alternative plan. Before that he convinces his sister that he saw a UFO and she believes him right away without even asking him follow up questions. Maybe it was a plane or something. It feels like the movie had 30 min cut out that would explain all these insane character choices. Stuff just happens for no reason. Peele is so obsessed with his theme that he forgets these are real characters.Similarly the movie is plastered with flashbacks. So while we explore the alien and try to understand it in a horror universe we jump back to totally unrelated scenes like a chimp attack sequence the theme park owner experienced as a child actor where the chimp on set, with a full audience looking on, just gets to attack actors without anyone stopping it. We just see it hang out on set covered in blood. An actor decides to run out from his hiding spot and the chimp attacks him too. It makes no sense. Why did he run out? Where is the trainer? Where are the guns? This whole side plot relevant to the alien that also is a wild animal yet it\\'s unrelated to the main plot and feels forced. And the theme park owner gets killed pretty fast anyhow so his life story is not important to the plot overall. At least we sorta understand why he died as it makes sense. Obviously selling the story to a big media company could net you like $1bn. But it does make sense he was trying to make a bit of cash by himself. With the camera man it makes ZERO sense. He should have said he wanted to get a closer shot and then died. Instead he just turns fully insane and nearly gets them all killed by letting the alien return. It feels forced.There is also a TMZ camera man who initially meets the sister. She knows the alien will kill him if he drives on. Yet instead of clearly warning him about death she says stuff like \"you should turn around\" and \"this is not a wise decision\". Just obscure stuff that sounds like there is zero danger. She never screams or raises her voice. Never tries to grab his bike. Never begs him. Nope, she just politely asks him to turn back while he is on her property. And he of course drives on to explore, as would anyone. Then she whines about having warned him to her brother. Which makes no sense as clearly she didn\\'t. Similarly both the camera man and the friend stare at the alien after being told quite clearly they will die if they do so. Yet they all stare. The sister keeps staring too. Again, it makes sense the theme park owner and the theme park guests died as they sorta didn\\'t understand the danger. But if you understand all rules yet keep breaking them it makes no logical sense. It\\'s not even 1 person. They all constantly break their own safety rules.At one point they fail to record the alien then just run away from the farm without saying or doing anything. They just eat together and hang out for a while then agree to try again. They could have hired a huge film crew to make sure they would record everything, or sold the story. Or at least have planned to stay indoors next time too as it\\'s safe. Yet they go back out there and ALL are outdoors. The alien clearly won\\'t eat the whole house yet none stay inside which makes zero sense. We just saw this was safe just like we heard that you are 100% safe if you never look at the alien. To die you need to go outside AND also stare at the alien. And even so you likely will survive anyhow.In a scene where they try to film a horse for an ad you also see how both the brother and sister just don\\'t understand anything. She comes late then walks over to the catering table a minute later without helping out. While the brother keeps letting the crew walk up to the horse again and again creating a dangerous situation. And this happens after the sister gave the safety speech where it was just 99% self-marketing. She only told people to turn off their ring tones. Never once told anyone to stay away from the horse or follow orders. So the crew kept scaring the horse again and again with the brother just looking on. And just like the sister and the TMZ journalist he politely vaguely tried to stop them. Clearly no one heard him.At the beginning the dad dies from a coin supposedly dropping from a plane and impaling into his eye. Yet this is impossible. Such a small object would never fall fast enough to even harm a person let alone kill him. When his son, the brother, drives him to the hospital he also doesn\\'t do anything to stop the bleeding while driving him and we see blood squirt all over the car. Which obviously causes the dad to bleed out and die.Overall the flashbacks make the horror way less effective as we jump back and forth. Plus it\\'s 2 different characters in 2 different locations. So it never feels like a full horror experience. And the flashbacks also take you out of an otherwise clear story. But I also feel like the ignorant characters do that by themselves. So while the movie is overall interesting it has a few faults that let it down. It also ends with nothing. We don\\'t know what shots they got or if they were useful. It feels like a story that didn\\'t try to say anything. Without flashbacks this could have been a cult classic horror movie about a violent alien as there is nothing like it. The tension feels real and fresh. Yet it tries a few too many things and becomes a tad weird. It\\'s bad storytelling.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Jordan Peele was very clever to keep so much of his film under wraps before release. By keeping so much of the storyline hidden the giant plot holes and general Hollywood ridiculousness was effectively hidden. Peele was even quoted as saying he was leaving things up to interpretation which makes me laugh now I've seen the film!Basically there is a cast of characters (all good actors, I have no problems with any of the acting) who are greedy and out for fame and self aggrandizement to the detriment of themselves, their town, and well, the world I guess. They discover a UFO, which is actually some kind of flying saucer like alien animal which goes around hovering up any creature that looks into its eyes (big hole?) and then upchucking anything indigestible(remember the Blob?), sometimes with a great deal of gore, but sometimes not? Not one, but two different sets of characters decide the best course of action would be to keep this dangerous being to themselves. One to feed it horses and entertain some folks at an amusement park and the others to get famous by...taking its picture.Then of course there's the more interesting plot line about Steven Yeung as a young sitcom actor traumatized by a chimp gone wild in his youth. This more intriguing plot goes nowhere and is entirely pointless, unfortunately. Maybe about the unpredictability of wild animals, but that's a stretch.Unlikeable, unrelatable characters. Ridiculous premise. Really just a basic creature feature would have been so much better.Why did it look like a flying saucer for so long but then have the square mouth and flowing geometry at the end? How it was dealt with at the end was beyond ridiculous; I won't reveal because you just have to see it. Don't expect any gore though because that has once again vanished.My guess this was just a money grab film. Keep it secret til it comes out, make the cash, don't worry about actually making any sense. We'll pretend it has great meaning and we won't 'explain' the meaning, because the audience thinks Peele is the next M. Night Shymalan. Just remember Shymalan was touted as the next great filmmaker also. He made a couple of really good films and then the rest have been pretty pathetic. And we, the audience, know that.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I don't know if this is a spoiler I'm pretty sure everyone knew going in that it was about aliens or at least hinted at being about aliens. That being said I loved the concept. Brilliant. People think they see flying saucers all the time. What if it wasn't a flying saucer but instead the alien itself. Again brilliant. My problems with the film were the holes in the story. Steven Yeun's character was a child actor on a sitcom about a family living with a monkey. Well the monkey loses it and ends up killing most of the cast and audience. The monkey however has a special relationship with him. Literally the only reason for these scenes is because his character runs a rodeo type show where he feeds the alien creature a horse. My best guess is those scenes were supposed to show why he thinks that he can have a special relationship with a violent creature. Also if you do a show in the desert where you show people an alien people are going to talk about it! Still it plays out as if he and Daniel's characters are the only ones that know about it. It would've made more sense if this was the first time he had ever shown anyone the alien. Another thing I didn't like about the film besides the title was Daniel Kaluuya's acting. I get that being stone-faced and stoic is kind of his thing but show at least a little emotion when a freaking alien is hovering over you! He wore the exact same expression the entire film. Keke Palmer was a highlight as well as the actor who played Angel. They were responsible for a lot of the comedic relief. Another thing that I was disappointed by until I realized the concept Jordan Peele was going for was there was this alien scene in the barn that was the coolest alien reveal scene I watched since the alien appeared in the TV screen at the end of Signs. I won't give it away. It was cool but not what Jordan was going for in the end. I enjoyed this film the most of Jordan peele's films but story-wise Get Out is the most well written and executed story he has done. But man, much like Hitchcock I appreciate Peele's originality and the suspense of his storytelling and his direction. He's so similar to Shyamalan that if they ever collaborated I would definitely be there for it.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I really like Get Out, but I was disappointed by Us - I went in presuming Us would be my bag, and though the premise is great, there were just too many loose ends for me and I found it frustrating -, so I didn\\'t go in to Nope with great expectations. I went in with an open mind, though.Nope is not as good as Get Out, but is better than Us, in that despite the fact it has a few loose ends it does have a narrative that follows and makes sense. Sure it\\'s about aliens, so it\\'s not going to make PERFECT sense, but in its own context it does.Personally, I was engaged throughout the film. It covers a few genres (horror, comedy, sci-fi, even Western-ish!) but to me it\\'s a comedy horror which is my favourite genre. The comedy moments are funny. The scary moments aren\\'t horrifically scary, but there is some fantastic imagery and tension.As for the alien. What can you do with aliens without copying what has been done before? Well, Nope\\'s alien is a unique design, which has to earn it credit. The alien\\'s \"motive\" is also unique, I believe, so Peele has done all he can to deliver something fresh.The Gordy\\'s Home side story doesn\\'t have anything to do with the alien/main storyline except to serve as a comparison, because the alien is animalistic and the chimp is an animal. I did think they might make more of Yeun\\'s character, but it\\'s a cool side story as long as you don\\'t get hung up on it.The film isn\\'t half as weird as some people are making it out to be, ultimately. It has a coherent narrative - brother and sister are trying to catch evidence of alien life, which is hovering in a cloud above their property and spooking/eating their horses at night, to make some money because their family business is failing, and it backfires inevitably causing chaos until a final \"fight\" scene and conclusion.'},\n",

Peele is one of those, who I have added recently to my list. Get Out and Us, both very strong thrillers, were different and unexpected. You never know what will happen or where it goes to. Same with Nope. The trailer gives some small bits away, but watching the whole movie was still a full puzzle of riddles and story lines coming together.I loved all performances... main actors and supporting ones. Everybody added a layer and made sense in the grand scheme. Keke Palmer was absolutely my favourite. Comic, nervous, emotional, scared,... she showed a lot of kinds of emotions and done it brilliantly.The scene with the monkey (which clearly everybody is talking about) has a meaning... even in 2 ways. An underlaying message, which is actually the grand message of the whole movie + a side step story to one of the characters. If you don't understand the main message, what Peele is trying to deliver... than nope, you will thing this scene is weird.Also loved all the movie references Peele inserted: ET, close encounters, war of the worlds, old skool alien movies,...The finale was great, seeing everything unfold. Quite u expected parts happening and adding more suspense. Everything is very well build up. It could have been just a little bit more scary to me. I was at the edge of my seat, but I didn't feel too scared all the way through. But, I loved the messed up feeling of Peele's ideasAlso props to the DOP, sound and music. It all added extra layers to the great directing. I absolutely need to see this again to put it all in place and wrap my head around. For sure a must watch!\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I see \"Nope\" as a parody of the alien invasion genre that was made quite well. Out of the three Jordan Peele movies, it is the one that I liked the most, because I felt that it was truly different from what we are used to seeing in commercial cinema nowadays. At the beginning I thought that this was just another UFO story, but there is a wonderful twist that changes things completely. The film keeps a mysterious vibe, by showing the point of view of the characters, that needs to face an unknown menace. There are many beautifully conceived shots and the film is dynamic: it does not lose time in pointless sub-plots or annoying dialogues. The director was focused and he told a nice and at times funny story, that\\'s it: pure entertainment with a bit of experimentation to keep things spicy.The acting is overall good, but I could not bear Emerald. She was really annoying as she screamed all the time. Keke Palmer\\'s acting feels too forced. It was really the only thing about this flick that I did not like and unfortunately by being one of the main characters, it slightly ruined my experience. The VFX are amazing: there are so many creative ideas and you get to see something different than the typical alien with gray skin and big black eyes. Peele is on the right path. \"Get Out\" was fine, but it did not bring anything new to the plate, while \"Us\" for me was a complete disaster. I am happy to finally give a solid 7 out of 10 to one of his projects.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Just got back from Nope, and my reaction to it was a yep (I'm guessing tons of people have made that joke already). While I enjoyed a lot about it, I found it slightly underwhelming. Granted, part of this might be my fault as I was expecting the film to be like Get Out and Us in the way of it tackling social issues again, but while I won't hold it against Peele if that wasn't his intention, I did feel like the film underexplained some details. For instance, the alien ship ultimately felt like an underdeveloped cypher where you know about as much about its purpose in the end as you do in the beginning. In addition, the disturbing yet arbitrary Gordy's Home sub-plot feels out of place here. In spite of that detail though, I think the characters remain consistently compelling for the most part and are developed enough for you to understand why they're willing to go to such great lengths to record the alien. Also, the film's technical craft is pretty unassailable and more than makes up for its flaws. It takes the awe of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the tension of Jaws and seamlessly combine them into what's undoubtedly the most technically impressive film Peele has made. Several horror sequences are a real blast to watch due to the craft on display, with the standout being Angel and Emerald hiding in their house while the alien passes overhead. This is the kind of film which needs to be watched on a bigger screen to get the full benefit of its thrills. Overall, while this isn't Peele's best film, it's still pretty good and worth checking out. Normally, I'd rate the film a bit lower than I am, but since its craft is impressive enough to elevate the film to a higher tier, I'm okay with giving it this rating.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"If it wasn't already abundantly clear after his first two feature films Get Out and Us, Jordan's Peele's third feature as a writer and director Nope proves once and for all that the comedian turned filmmaker is not at all intent on chasing the low hanging fruit when it comes to delivering fresh and unique films.A film that for a long time was shrouded in the type of secrecy normally reserved for a Christopher Nolan film, Nope slowly revealed itself to be some type of sci-fi/horror hybrid that may or may not be an alien invasion movie but without spoiling any of the surprises that lay in store for those heading into the film for the first time, Peele's version of what is perhaps to be expected from a certain type of film is unlikely to be what audiences are expecting, with Nope becoming anything but a typical big budget blockbuster event.Teaming up with renowned cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, Peele and his right hand man take us into the Californian area of the Agua Dulce where sibling horse farm owners OJ and Emerald Haywood begin to suspect that something is amiss on their usually quiet property, with the prospect of an unknown entity making itself at home in their surrounds causing the mismatched duo to enact a plan to uncover the mystery of what may or may not be present in their lands.Taking a typically slow-paced approach to proceedings much like he did with Get Out and Us, the plotting and style in which Nope's story unfolds will not be for everyone and despite an unnerving and eye-opening pre-credits sequence of events taking place, Nope is in no rush to get the ball rolling when it comes to big money shot segments or major plot developments but there's a chilling and mysterious tone at the core of every one of Nope's runtime minutes that makes it a gripping watch for the most part but one that never manages to fully capitalize on its many great ideas and moments, that culminate in a unique but not exactly satisfying final stretch.Neither a genuine science fiction experience nor a straight up horror exercise, Nope holds within it some of the most interesting ideas and scenes (extended scenes held around a western theme park audience/a chimpanzee named Gordy and a bloody incident at the Haywood's farm clear standouts) you're going to see in a film this year but at times it's hard to fully comprehend what Peele is trying to achieve with Nope's overall messaging and the purpose behind it all outside of an examination of mankind's inability to understand its powers in controlling things we have no right to control, with the visually appeasing but messy final act leaving Nope feeling like a film with great parts but not such a great all-round package.Three films in it still feels as though Peele's greatest feat yet as a director is till too come with all of his final products harboring incredibly realized moments and more unique ideas than countless other films could dare to conjure up but while Nope is a cinematic spectacle and another tick for the industries new wonderkid, there's still a few too many missteps to classify it as a masterpiece despite at times reaching that level of justified praise.Final Say -An entirely unique cinematic and narrative experience, Nope is another worthy effort from Jordan Peele but one that doesn't always come off the way in which we would've hoped, holding it back from the greatness that lays within arms reach throughout.3 1/2 roof pigs out of 5.For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)\"},\n",

I held on waiting for the parts that would make this a classic in the making, and it never came.I have since done research as to why people are propping this film up, and why the filmmaker is being given such a glowing praise, and i have had my eyes opened up to a lot of scandalous actions that are taking place in the west.Let's just say that this film is not being given credit because it's good (It's not), it's being given credit because of who made and who stared in the movie.No wonder entertainment is at an all-time low point when the best are no longer being employed and celebrated. Now inclusivity is more important to the people who make the rules and we are now supposed to agree with whatever is being said.Such a sad world we live in.This film is garbage. Trust me please people.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya) and his father are horse trainers on a remote California ranch. Out of the blue sky, his father is killed by objects falling to Earth. OJ is left with his irresponsible sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) and they lose work on a film set. OJ has to sell his horses to neighbor former child star Ricky 'Jupe' Park (Steven Yeun). The siblings suspect an UFO hounding their ranch and go to buy surveillance equipment. Angel Torres (Brandon Perea) comes to install the equipment.It's a relatively simple story. I can't help but think that Jordan Peele could have split this movie into ideas for several episodes of his Twilight Zone. He's throwing a lot of ideas into this. For some, it may be too many ideas. The overall UFO story has its issue. It's obvious that Jordan got some of the UFO ideas from a cuttlefish but I would still clean some of that up. The idea of faces staring up at the UFO gets a bit muddled. It's a metaphor for fame in some way but I would rather work out the real-world logic instead. Besides that, this movie does have two terrific side-trips. I love the fake out by Jupe's kids and I love Jupe's flashback. Like I said before, those ideas could be turned into great Twilight Zone episodes. Despite some minor issues, this is a good Jordan joint.\"},\n",

Night Shyamalan in this and well done, he has messed it up as much as Shymalan would have with their loud and over the top scenes which they reckon will stir up the audience as long as they don't think too much about what they are actually looking at!The urbaness of the characters is so overdone and the attempt at humour keeps falling flat.Lastly, did I miss why it's called Nope apart from the fact that would be the answer anyone should give if asked if this movie is worth a watch.

If you can afford to go to the movies with inflation as high as it is, then this is the movie to see.I am not a professional critic but the scenes shot on the ranch were intoxicating. It might be because I am so used to seeing pollution in the sky. The way that the two main protagonists were established at the beginning was excellent. I empathised with person A because of one reason and disliked person B because of their motivations.The side characters were a joy to watch and their motivations were made clear. The antagonist remained a mystery as did its' motivations so that the tension was extremely high towards the end of act II. Act III drug the movie down though.There was enough action to keep the audience invested but the actual fact that certain events occur without any logical reason makes this a grind to get through.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"In the Haywood Hollywood horse ranch, OJ Haywood is shocked when his father is suddenly fatally wounded by falling debris from the sky. After a commercial of the ranch goes badly, OJ and his sister Em lose the opportunity and they need to make a decision on what to do with the ranch. When OJ considers selling some of the horses to a former child star turned carnival entertainer. However, the siblings suddenly encounter a UFO that has been attacking and eating their horses while spitting out inedible matter. From there, OJ and Em try to get the perfect shot to prove the existence of the strange UFO.I loved both of Jordan Peele's first two movies. Both of them are unique and original while being scary and effective while having some strong themes in them. His new movie, Nope, takes a different approach from his first two films. Instead of being a straight up horror film, it is actually more of a sci-fi thriller than a horror film. However, that does not make any less frightening because Jordan Peele's Nope had me shaking in some scenes.There are at least two scenes in the film that are extremely disturbing in the best possible way. Very rarely does a horror movie actually scare me even after it is over, but this one did just that. I now do not want to ever see a flying UFO... the story subverts several expectations and puts on a very unique and scary twist on the UFO. The result is an alien movie that made me squirm. The script shows how putting small changes or twists can go a long way to make horror elements feel inventive and new.As for the rest of the story, it starts off pretty slow. I had a hard time connecting to the story at first, but it not only picks up around the second act, but it actually answers some questions in part one making it more interesting. Some elements and details that seem weird in the first half make more sense after the events of the second half. There is a fantastic subplot regarding an animal actor that is a parallel to the main story. The moral? Dangerous animals or creatures should not be used for entertainment. This is one of the subplots that I really like because not only is it just as scary as the UFO, but it is relevant to the main story.The last act is where I think people be divisive on. I think it is a very good change of pace from the horror content we have gotten from Jordan Peele. The climax is nerve-wracking as the siblings find ways to lure the UFO. I feel as if the movie takes inspiration from classic creature features in the way that the climactic encounter unfolds. It is made like a spectacle and it works very well. The third act is exciting and scary because of how vicious the UFO is despite the tonal shift.Performance-wise, I loved Keke Palmer in this role. She is very energetic and animated. Palmer looks like she is having the time of her life here. She also plays her more stoic brother played by Daniel Kaluuya very well. Kaluuya has little emotion here as he feels like that guy who just seems done with the world. You can even tell it in his eyes that he is just irritated. At first, I did not like this performance, but the longer the movie went on, the more I appreciated it as he plays this character perfectly while showing some strong signs of losing his cool after encountering the UFO. There are two great supporting performances from Steve Yeun and Brandon Perea, the former who plays as a character who shows signs of a man troubled by his childhood and the latter who plays as a likable tech salesman who is realistically scared of what is happening. He is not over-the-top cowardly or outright oblivious to the danger, but he is instead freaking out like any normal person would, but still tries to help the siblings catch the UFO on camera. This is a solid cast of characters where even the supporting characters work well with the plot, especially Yuen's character.Visually, the movie has some inventive production design. Regarding the UFO, it looks like any normal UFO, but when you get to see what is inside of it, that is when it becomes disturbingly unique. It looks great and the effects are very good. The UFO itself looks very believable making it all the more terrifying. The cinematography is also gorgeous. There are several shots that show a lot about the themes and the danger the people in this area face. On top of that, we have a fantastic musical score that fits the tone of the movie, both the horror aspects and the oddly whimsical aspects. Even the sound design is great, especially during the scene where the twist with the UFO is revealed.Jordan Peele is three for three with Nope. He continues to show how much skill and imagination he has with filmmaking. The script has a lot of stuff in it and not everything works, but what does work had me hooked. Nope is very strange and original, but it has some old school charm to it. I want to see more genre mixed films like this. If you are a fan Peele's other films, you will get a kick out of this.\"},\n",

Kaluuya is the stand out in the film, Keke Palmer is beyond irritating from the moment she steps on screen.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Let me preface this by saying that I am very skeptical of movie reviews. Sometimes the reviewers like a movie that I don't like. Other times they don't like a movie that I like. I'm one of those people that will take a chance to actually watch a movie and form my own opinion on it. With that said, Nope is a good movie. With the popularity of streaming sites and superhero movies, people are used to a specific formula when it comes to a story . They are not a fan of slow burn storytelling. Nor are they a fan of movies that make you think. When most people think of Jordan Peele they immediately think of his first movie Get Out. People use that movie as a litness test and think that anything else that he releases is supposed to be just like that movie. Us and Nope are completely different.I feel like a lot of movies are being dismissed because they are not catering to the immediate gratification crowd. That's a shame! As for the movie nope, there are some excellent performances in this movie. The story is complex but it's not hard to understand if you pay attention. There is a twist at the end that proves that the trailers did not spoil the movie at all. Basically, the movie is not that hard to understand. The conversations that occur which explain everything that happens. There's some things that you will pick up instantly and others that you will understand when you sit down and really think about what you've seen. It may take more than one viewing to fully understand the movie. As for the criticisms and confusion about the chimpanzee and the sitcom scenes, they pertain to another situation that happens later in the story. For instance, the idea that it is impossible to tame a predator surfaces more than once in the story. I won't spoil it for you but once you realize their theme it makes sense.If you're really interested in watching this movie then go and see it and make your own judgment. I personally think that this movie is misunderstood by a lot of people who never intended on trying to understand it in the first place. I hate to agree with certain directors and their criticisms of the current state of cinema but they are correct. Unfortunately, streaming and superhero movies have change the landscape of movie going and not for the better. Not all stories are going to unfold immediately for you. Sometimes the best movies really make you think.\"},\n",

I was in absolute awe the entire duration and the way all these subtle things link together was so well thought out, it's hard to not be blown away. In the whole film there's roughly 2-3 jumpscares and it is still one of the most engaging and unsettling films i've seen in the cinema. The plot blew me away completely and the performances, twists and dialogue made the characters so relatable and so engaging with brilliant music and score that'll make you shake. The audio in this film is incredible. The noises from the ufo and the surroundings make you feel so uneasy and so shaken, to the point you actually feel a bit ill.Even with most critically acclaimed films i can agree with peoples dislikes but with NOPE, im genuinely clueless as to why. Yes it had some generic tiny issues, but all horror films always do. There is no such thing as a perfect horror film but NOPE is very close to being so.In conclusion, i believe this to not only be a Peele's best film, but one of the most visually and audibly best films i've seen in an extremely long time.

It goes on for way too long, and I ended the film disappointed, in that I'd spent 2 hours of my life watching it.Compared to Jordan Peele's other films, this one just really doesn't hit the mark at all. In fact, the most exciting part about this film is the ending, when the credits begin to roll and you are able to turn the film off and pretend it never happened.The acting from Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer were as good as always and were perhaps the only redeeming quality. The duo had a good flow between them, just a shame that there was no real direction for them to lead with.Simply, it just felt like a film with no substance.\"},\n",

There are things from the beginning that you are waiting for a reason or reveal as to why those events happened; but you will be leaving the theatre feeling empty and hollow.It felt like Jordan Peele had 2 movie scripts going at once, accidentally jumbled them up; then decided not to fix any of it and just said \"ah screw it, just proceed\". It is one of the most disappointing new releases that I have seen in the past year or so, and I could not; nor will not ever be able to recommend this film to anyone on this planet.With that said, the acting and cinematography was great; but nothing that can redeem this utter disappointment of a movie.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Nope is one of those interpretable movies in many ways. For me, this film criticizes the way in which the film industry, television and even social networks are moved to some extent by the curiosity to see something dangerous, but spectacular. It feels like a direct dart even for horror filmmakers, who are full of ambition trying to satisfy the morbidity of those who are drawn to the sensation that controls fear and who are looking for more experiences that draw a sigh of terror from them. All this is channeled through a clear comparison: the domestication of animals to be exhibited in shows. Peele exemplifies this by showing us that if things were done correctly and by the correct professionals, there would be no problem, as in the training of horses. Then the director shows you when things go wrong in the bumpy chimp episode. But then there is a third alternative. And it is here where the film takes off to get lost in a storm of ideas, metaphors and teachings that can be seen as an unintelligible excess of concepts or as genius. In my opinion it is the first. Peele cannot get his final message across in an understandable way. The inclusion of humor, action, and suspense to create a compelling end product, and even a new and original twist, is highly valued, but these are factors on the periphery of a confusing and ill-defined main concept.As for the technical aspects, there are many very good elements, such as photography, sound, performances, effects, both special and visual, and the direction itself, which shines with excellent shots. The montage divided into chapters that bear the name of the protagonist's different horses is also an exquisite detail. But I insist, despite the fact that the execution is very well applied, if the film fails to convey its message, the technical details remain in the shadow of being in a disposable work.\"},\n",

However, when they believe that they have witnessed some kind of phenomenon they try to profiteer from what they have witnessed without fully understanding what they are actually dealing with...Jordan Peele has come up with a semi-interesting idea here, but it is one that is so long and so drawn-out that it very quickly becomes trying upon one\\'s patience...So what actually happens before \"hell is let loose\" is the $64,000 question, but honestly very little happened here that managed to hold my interest....Nope is a carrot-dangler where nothing happens enough to simulate the average viewer and where, effectively, you have 90 minutes of boring scenes filmed in the desert that don\\'t add up to a great amount. The film, is rather, pretentiously presented in chapters which, ultimately, make about as much sense as the rest of the film.Truth be told, the film does not have an engaging bone in its body and this is made worse by the rather weak ending (the film builds itself up to be something great a premise you feel it cannot deliver upon).Ending with positives, I thought Keke Palmer was fantastic and a real revelation (she had the bravado and sass that was required for Peele\\'s vision).

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I rarely write reviews but I have to write one for this one. This is the second IMDB review I\\'ve ever had to write.Let me just say I was utterly disappointed with this one. One would expect the satisfaction level of watching this recent movie to be the same as watching movies previously made by Jordan Peel because he directed decently \"Us\" and \"Get out\"-which are movies not without their flaws but are still fairly enjoyable.So because it\\'s a Jordan Peele movie, you think that \"it being made by Jordan Peel\" would be one aspect that shall draw or suck you into wanting to watch the movie, but the movie turns out to lack the thrill and interesting aspects of Us and Get out that made those movies exciting and enjoyable to watch.Mind you, as an experienced movie watcher, I know it is not the slow-paced-ness, lacking-of-plot-ness of a movie that makes a movie \"bad\" (forgive me for the simplistic term) as long as everything fits together, no scene is wasted and and you keep on wanting to see more and more of the movie as you watch along.BUT on the contrary, the lack of logical plot development AND slow-paced-ness of this movie sucked too much that you just wish for the movie to get at least less boring near the half of the movie since the movie drags on and on.The movie is too boring to the core with useless scenes where characters just stare at each other and you\\'re expected to smirk and understand what hidden cues are in the characters\\' staring at each other. Scenes are filled with characters just doing nothing but staring at each other and you trying to figure out how they tie into the movie.Let me say the average person would surely want to stop watching before half of the movie is even finished.Also, there are no clear symbolism of the Alien, the alien shifting shape at the end, the horse, or why the movie is even set on a horse ranch.Again, this is only my opinion but many will feel this way.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Going into this movie, i knew very little about it, mostly because the trailers fantastically kept you interested without revealing the whole plot, like so many movies do. Sadly the movie itself isn't quite so fantastic. What i knew in advance about his thriller (not a horror btw), is it's about some weird goings on, on a ranch and that is mostly the story to be honest. Without spoiling too much there's some supernatural alien s**t happening and there's some very weird scenes, most of which are explained, but they do engage you to wonder what's going on and i think that's a good thing. It makes for a very original movie. Unfortunately there's also some big flaws here. Most of all, a bizarre sub-plot involving a Chimp, that not only was unnecessary, it was completely unconnected and also not explained. A total waste of screen time.As for the Actors, well, most of them did ok, nothing phenomenal, although i did find Keke Palmer incredibly annoying and often hard to understand (as an English person).What i did like though was how the thrills and reveal of the entities, was slowly built up and we had a few sneaky tricks in there too.So overall i would say this movie was ok and nothing i'm going to remember in the future, but if you can tolerate the incredibly slow first 30 mins, this still becomes an interesting sci-fi thriller that at least hasn't been done a million times before.What i find odd though is why this has such a high rating when most of the reviews i see are more harsh than even i have been. I say judge for yourself, it's one of those movies where some will love it, others will scratch their heads wondering what the heck they just watched.Edit... I have just looked up for some explanations for the parts of this movie that really didn't make sense and didn't seem relevant and what have i learned? That they weren't relevant, but the Director obviously was told that, so he made up some connections that weren't there and still didn't make any sense. Sorry but on that fake explanation basis, i'm reducing my rating. If there's meant to be a connection of the weird things happening in a movie, then explain it in the movie, not after people tell you your movie doesn't make any sense.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Jordan Peele, writer and director, is known for making movies where the stories have some kind of underlying message in them and that stays true with Nope and I got to say this one might be the hardest to figure out and that's why I enjoy it. After watching this movie I was still trying to fully figure out what the message was and then looked into it to learn that there are many theories out there, which makes this story interesting. There probably is one main message to be taken away from this movie but I love the fact that lots of people can go and watch this movie and analyze it in their own ways based on both interpretations and life experiences. With all that being said, though, to fully grasp this movie's story, I would recommend two viewings to thoroughly pick up every detail. But even without the underlying message in this movie the story for this movie is an interesting one and sucks you in with the mystery. I will say that to get fully into the mystery of this movie is a slow one, more on this soon, that is needed to set things up but once all hell breaks loose and the movie goes full horror is when things get really interesting. Like I said even though the first part of this movie is slower than the rest and is required it really does mess with the pacing of this movie.The pacing for this movie is best defined as being a slow burn that quickly becomes a full-on fire. This movie is two hours and ten-minutes-long and at certain parts, in the movie, you don't feel that time length but in others, you do and unfortunately for a decent chunk of this movie you feel it. I will say that even though you do feel the slower pacing of the movie it is necessary to help properly tell the story but there are some scenes that could've been cut down a bit. I won't explicitly say which scene it is but there is one scene in this movie that I feel like some people might find an issue with, me included, but is a perfect example of one that helps the underlying message.But one of the key things in this movie to help people not focus on the pacing for this movie is the acting which was really well done to a certain extent. What I mean by that is everybody in this movie, but one person, gives it their all in this movie. The main standouts being Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer and Steven Yeun, who plays Ricky Park. I enjoyed how Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer played such polar opposite siblings that anybody with a sibling can probably relate to the two of them. I also loved how Keke Palmer's performance changed from the beginning of the movie to the end of it and showed how some people in this situation might act. I do have to say that those two are the biggest standouts due to the movie mainly focusing on them and not fully giving time to the others. The only exception to that statement is Steven Yeun who plays this unstable man just so well that I wanted to see more of him in this movie. I feel like if Brandon Perea, who plays Angel Torres, was given more screen time he could've been a real standout.I, unfortunately, wasn't able to watch this movie in IMAX due to my theatre not offering it but, I do recommend that if you see this movie to see it either in IMAX or some type of theatre with a good sound system not because that's how this movie was made but because of the sound. Now, if you're sensitive to loud noises then maybe say nope to this movie or see it in a regular type of theatre because the sounds in this movie can get loud. The sound design in this movie was really well done and helped create this atmosphere of tension. From the sound design of the UFO to just random sound bits in this movie you're going to be on the edge of your seat constantly. The sound design also helps create some of the scares in this movie that even those who aren't easily scared will get startled. The last thing I'll say about the sound is I also really dug the score for this movie, especially the final song in the movie.The last things I'll talk about are the directing and cinematography in this movie. Both of these things combined with the sound design for this movie helped create this terrifying movie. There's one scene in this movie that was just jaw-dropping at how amazing it looked and needed to be seen on the big screen. In the end, Nope might not be Jordan Peele's best movie but is definitely worth checking out and not saying nope to.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The only two things that are good in the movie are the different and strange UFO design and its creepy sound, that's all. There's not a complete story to follow, no clearly developed characters, just nothing. There are some scenes that don't even work for the overall storyline. It's just an UFO creating a mess. The first 40-45 minutes of the movie is extra boring. Go watch Close Encounters of the Third Kind and/or Signs, they are much better about suspense and thriller and containing UFO's. This is the only bad movie of Jordan Peele. His Get Out and Us movies are much much better; this movie is just him trying to make an UFO movie that is about an UFO storming around and killing people, and 4 people trying to capture it.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Peele tried to do something special here. You have never seen an alien like that and a story that revolves around African-American animal trainers. Together with colorful characters such as portrayed by Steven Yeun it is posed to deliver an entertainment value never seen before on screen. However that swing ultimately misses. The movie is slow-burning and not in a good way, no smart dialogues or life lessons. The alien is silly and the keys and coins falling down is down-right silly, it has already been proven a fallen penny cannot kill you, mostly due to air resistance.Overall I feel this movie was over-hyped, with a catchy name of Nope, reminding me of other atrocities such as the movie \"LOL\", while not as bad, it\\'s really a title that burns into your memory long after you forget what this movie was all about.There\\'s really not much happening in the movie, you could probably sum it up in one paragraph. SPOILER- They fought it, it survived inter-stellar travel but died from eating a balloon. But no worries, since the real goal was to get a picture of the thing, the old well-camera, has infinite focal zoom (even though it is planned for no more than 6 ft) catches a clean shot of the thing.Well, you get my drift, the movie is silly, the action scenes are mediocre, some of them are in complete darkness, and there\\'s really not much to learn from it, Peele created here something passable but far from legendary. It really not a must-see, I am giving it a very generous 3 stars as there are some good parts in it here and there.Exact score: 57 / 100.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'So my full thoughts on Nope. Will be entirely honest, but I really liked the film, more so than Us namely because it doesn\\'t suffer the issue of an exposition dump like the previous film did. I completely understand why some dislike the film or view Peele as overrated because, in some way, he is because some movie critics put him on that high a pedestal even when he refuses to identify himself as being close to the likes of John Carpenter. But I do enjoy his films for the most part because I can tell he is passionate about what he is doing.In terms of the narrative, Nope is a simple story about two siblings trying to keep their ranch afloat by taking authentic pictures of a UFO but they are way out of their league when it comes to what the UFO truly is.If anything, the story feels by the book and safe. But I don\\'t see how anyone could come out of the film thinking it was boring. The first two acts of the film I felt were great but the third act is the one that is easily hit or miss. I loved the climax of the film, but I won\\'t lie when saying the film felt incomplete/half-baked with the ending being abrupt. But that is more because I was truly invested with the film up to that point and I wanted there to be more to it.If anything, the film is more a character study than a horror film despite having scary moments. Daniel\\'s character OJ is vanilla at best. I disagree with the idea he is boring or uninteresting because he is monotonous, but I would argue that the film isn\\'t entirely about him, but more that he serves as an outlet for more eccentric characters like Emerald, Angel, and Jupe. Even then, his stoic nature proves to be crucial when it comes to understanding the beast.Emerald carries the movie with how she is more energetic than her brother and does have a semblance of a character arc where she tries to help snap a picture of the UFO not just because she wants to save the ranch, but also because she wanted to make it big herself. She also has some slight resentment toward her late father as well. In addition, she is funny.Angel is an okay addition. He also has his humorous moments such as his musing of Ancient Aliens and he is by no means stupid.Jupe I admit I was somewhat disappointed that he wasn\\'t in the film for about 2/3 of it despite us spending time developing his character and childhood trauma. At first, I did dislike that, but I did feel like it was enough.It all goes back to the underlying message of how people are willing to do anything to get that perfect spectacle even and how Hollywood treats its performing animals like living props that they chew up and discard. With that kind of disrespect, it leads to bad consequences for the people much like what happened with Gordy the Chimp which is definitely the scariest part of the film.After surviving his encounter with the crazed chimp, Ricky believed that he was able to have some control over wild animals which I feel comes from the fact he was not looking directly at Gordy but instead looking at a shoe bizarrely standing on its heel. In my interpretation, the shoe is one of the \"bad miracles\" OJ was talking about. It saves Ricky at that moment but he did not take that as a cautionary tale instead doubling down on that due to his obsession with reclaiming his lost fame.As for everything else, the soundtrack is excellent, and I did not think the acting was bad as there were several good performances to list. The cinematography is especially fantastic befitting the spectacle notion Peele was wanting.So...I was satisfied for the most part with the film. Sure, I did want more in the film to make it feel more tightly wound, but I nevertheless did enjoy it.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '4* out of 10*This film is per se well-directed, has mostly good cinematography, suspense and tension and some intense scenes. It offers some great visuals and images that linger with you. I truly respect Peele for his original film-making, weirdness and ambition. Even though, this film did not convince me, it had me thinking about it a lot. Unfortunately, Peele\\'s ambition ultimately leads to the film\\'s downfall: it is convoluted, unfocused and can\\'t seem to make up its mind about what it ultimately wants to convey. There are too many storylines, subplots and hinted-at events that do not really come together.I do get (most of) the messages: The UFO and the reactions towards it are a symbol for people\\'s desire to become famous and monetize everything and anything without considering the risks. It is somehow about people\\'s obsession with art, fame, celebrities, technology, social media and the like. Also about Hollywood\\'s and the entertainment industry\\'s exploitation and lack of respect for animals and minorities. Most of the symbolism is done rather heavy-handed, see e.g. The TMZ guy on the motorcycle. Yeah, he is also a reference to Akira.... - so what?However, none of these ideas are particularly new or innovative. And: where does it all go? It never ties together and fails to produce a compelling personal story. No real arc for the characters. In the end, they are no better than the TMZ guy because they chase the same goal: to get footage of the Alien and turn it into cash. That\\'s the main story on the surface. How are we supposed to root for them if they never evolve into better persons? Overall, the movie concerns itself too much with cramming as many symbols and references into itself as possible. When what Peele should have been doing, is focussing on a consistent narrative, fleshed-out characters and a clear message. The film is so full of pop-cultural references, clever winks, easter eggs and symbolism and therefore full of itself that instead of elevating the story, it rather becomes distracting and annoying.References to greater things (Jaws, Close Encounters, Signs, Kubrick, Westerns, Hitchcock and too many more to list) and underlying symbolism plus some suspense alone unfortunately don\\'t make for a good film. These should not become an end in themselves but should serve a higher purpose: telling a good story. What good are all these hints and symbols if they don\\'t tie together in an overarching narrative. Signs e.g. Also had all of these things. What makes SIGNS SO MUCH OF A BETTER FILM THAN NOPE is that it also has a clear idea about its characters, it had a cohesive narrative and the messages it wanted to bring across. As a bonus it had clever writing and a heart. And most importantly Shyamalan knew that less is more. Peele seems to follow the opposite approach: There is always room for MORE even though it has not much to do with my story or my characters.Sadly, there is a really interesting story and probably an enticing movie inside of it all. Only, it is not the main \"story\" but rather the side plot about Park (Steven Yeun), the amusement park guy, and his tragic background story. Imo, the most thrilling scenes were the flashbacks to the absolutely menacing chimpanzee amok, the scene in Park\\'s office and then his lasso-show. These were all intense and well-directed and had me on the edge of my seat. Even with the little screen time he has, Park\\'s character is way more interested and better developed than our main protagonists. Even though I see how these events are supposed to tie into the overarching message, Peele failed to successfully wave them into the main plot. Hence there was no pay-off on this plot. Funnily, this had the effect that although I wanted to see more of this character and the ape story, whenever they came up I had the feeling that they led nowhere and only further prolonged a film that was already completely overloaded. Maybe, this is the film Peele should have actually made.While the actors are doing a good job for the most part, the characters are all over the place. Kaluuya\\'s OJ is fine, I guess, but he is so laconic and bare of emotions, it is hard to care for him. The sister Em is just nervewreckingly obnoxious. What\\'s more, is that I felt zero chemistry between the siblings. There was no reason to care about the tech savvy Fry employee either. And the film dude with the painfully artificial deepthroat-voice was plain annoying (Is this the sheriff of Nottingham from Robin Hood??).While the first 30-45 minutes do a great job of building a world, creating tension, the film suffocates on its overload in the latter two thirds. During the introduction, a lot is left in the dark - or behind the clouds - and therefore up to our imagination. I think it was after we fully see the UFO/Alien (which happens way too early and for my taste shouldn\\'t have happened at all) that the film takes a turn for the worse. The final act is way too long and should have been cut for at least 20 minutes. Plus, it is super repetitive and uses the same scenes and set pieces over and over. When the UFO turns into a giant bed-sheet-squid I ultimately stopped caring. The film turns into a meandering cat-and-mouse-sequence that\\'s rather underwhelming. By focussing so much on the SPECTACLE and showing us everything of it and then some, Peele makes it less effective.The final fight is rather ant-climatic. After it\\'s all said and done, OJ is - of course - still alive. Even though, after all we saw during the film, there would have been no chance for him to survive. Killing him off might have brought some impact to his actions and his arc - but nope.No consistent logic or rules and many plotholes within the film. It is established that you can avoid being eaten if you don\\'t look into the UFO\\'s eyes (where are these eyes, btw?). Still, some who adhere to this do get eaten, others don\\'t. If Steven Yeun had been incorporating this thing into his shows: Why weren\\'t he and his visitors eaten in previous shows? Why would he spend 11.500 bucks for the horses instead of just feeding cows to the thing? How had word about a giant alien spacecraft not spread out after previous shows?'},\n",

The cinematography alone is worth the score I've given, after seeing so much god awful Marvel, Disney or Netflix CGI fests with no meaning or weight this is the highlight of the year.This is what you might want to call a Supernatural, Sci Fi, Western. It all starts with a mystery then bombards you with more mystery slowly unravelling what is lurking beyond the clouds.On top of the big mystery there is also the motivations that are behind those involved unveiling it. Sometimes you don't have to say too much or force feed a narrative, a good film just flows.There are a few negatives regarding pacing and slower moments as well as a lack of clear direction when occasionally things seemingly meander away or get a bit lost. However all of these moments are part of the bigger picture and help.explain a lot.A lot of the experience is visual and cerebral, our own questions and fears come into the equation until eventually its all laid out in front of you like a jigsaw puzzle you never thought you could complete.In the end its not complex, there is no real twist, its more about human and nature but with a supernatural element.The action packed finale done in perfect bright daylight within the surrounding Savanna was brilliant. Too many movies being filmed in low light due to either budget constraints, technical ineptness or lack of imagination.This is certainly a film that lacks any sort of political agenda, its not preaching about this ideology or that, its probably the least political film ive seen in a long time.This is definitely a film I will come back to next year.Until the final 3rd i may have rated this lower but it has to be an 8 out of 10 for that finale.\"},\n",

It's sitting at a 7 but I really want to give it an 8 however I need to watch the movie again before I do that so 7 for now. Nope is a weird film for me. 2/3rd's of this movie is insanely good but the last 30 minutes are just kind of underwhelming to me. I'm hoping on rewatch that my thoughts will change. The ending only feels underwhelming because it felt somewhat less dramatic than the rest of the film. The whole movie for the first 2/3rds is creepy and downright terrifying at points and that isn't there for the 3rd act. That's really my major critique but since it's the climax of the movie it does stick out like a sore thumb to me. Like I said though, the rest of the movie is insanely good. It's scary at points and just downright disturbing in all the ways a horror movie should be. Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya are amazing in this and I hope to see more great performances from them in the future. Their characters are really fun to watch and get behind as they are just like us. Humans are naturally drawn to the unknown and sometimes we do whatever is necessary to try and capture it to show the world. The Gordy segments can seem a little confusing as to what they mean but not only are they downright scary and terrifying but it really adds to one of the film's messages about not underestimating a wild animal as you don't know how they will react regardless of how much you try to train them. The technical aspects of this film are pretty amazing across the board. The visual effects, sound design, cinematography, and music are all some of the best of the year and are definitely worth the price of admission. While I'm still a little unsure about the ending I still think that you should go see this film as soon as possible for everything else that I mentioned.\"},\n",

But does anyone know who rode the horse in that film, where Muybridge sought to determine if a running horse leaves the ground? That man was black so of course: \"Nope.\" OJ repeats the word when he refuses to surrender to the invasion, to give up.It\\'s writer/director Jordan Peele\\'s film mission to say \"Nope\" to the American tradition of marginalizing or omitting the African American from its history, values, consciousness. As in Get Out (2017) and Us (2019) he inflects the familiar genres by centering on the black experience and reversing its traditional suppression. Because he\\'s liberating a long vilified force he naturally works in the horror genres, whether Monster or Sci-Fi.As Emerald points out, \"Since the moment pictures could move, we had skin in the game.\" Not just in the pictures, but throughout the fabric of American life - where permitted.The Hollywood horse-training family supposedly descends from Muybridge\\'s unnamed rider. It names the unnamed and imbues the suppressed with a tradition.This film is especially self-referential in the number of references to film-making, explicitly in the opening scene and in the later attempts to film the outer space phenomenon. Jupe Park\\'s pitch for his neo-Western live entertainment show promises to transform the spectator. Though not in his intended way, it does - elimination.Indeed the theme is introduced in the Biblical epigraph:\"Nahum 3:6: I will cast abominable filth upon you, make you vile, and make you a spectacle.\"\\nIn the alien monster\\'s final attack the saucer is replaced by a flowery shape (more Georgia O\\'Keeffe than Melies) that keeps erupting into cinema-screen rectangles. Emerald triumphs by feeding that creature a huge balloon winking Fat Boy - that she fatally explodes. As historic lies and myths eventually must.The palimpsest narrative includes flashbacks to the TV sitcom that Jupe Park created and starred in as a lad. It also summons Peele\\'s own background in TV sitcoms, before he found his satiric voice in sketch TV. In this sequence the tamed chimp center of the TV series runs amok and slaughters the show \"parents.\" Figure Cheetah bloodily offing Ozzie and Harriet.That apparent tangent actually parallels the major plotline. Given the traditional racist equation of African American with monkey, the sitcom hero\\'s revolt replays OJ\\'s and Emerald\\'s reversal of the reduction of the Black experience in American history and mythology.Similarly, in naming his hero OJ Peele provides a precise antithesis to the OJ we immediately recall. That\\'s the Simpson who was the college and NFL House N-word, who beat a murder rap, vowing to pursue his wife\\'s killer through every golf course in the land, and was finally jailed for the armed theft of - what else? - OJ memorabilia. Peele replaces that OJ in our consciousness with a reticent, courageous, shy, noble, generous and sensitive servant both to horse and to humanity, to art and to life.In short, that \"Nope\" is a firm denial of the American abuse. Neglect and denial of the Black experience. The sci-fi playground makes it a true \"No, in Thunder.\"'},\n",

But it was made from all your leftover LEGO parts so it looks a little messy.There were a lot of good things here: the characters, the performances, the concepts and the twists. My favorite thing was how strange/wild some of the shots were combined with how well they fit into the story--the rustic country littered with multicolored skydancers, the house getting drenched in blood, or the odd cut-backs to when the chimp massacred all those people. It all made perfect sense within the story, but out of context, they are like those funny shaped LEGO pieces you don't know what to do with.I appreciate that Peele took time at the beginning to introduce and build the main characters also. It makes any conclusions much more satisfying.I was entertained from start to finish, even if the end result felt a little cluttered and messy. It was a good cluttered and messy.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"First off, I have to say that the movie is beautifully shot. It's been rare nowadays to see movies that create a sensation of seeing a blockbuster on the big screen. It has a very spielbergian quality to it, in terms of scope and immersing the viewer into the action.I have not seen trailers so I had no expectations going in, but the movie would have worked so much better for me if it stayed more simple (like Jaws) and deliver a more satisfying conclusion.The social commentary is bending the story so much that it shatters. There are many themes about voyeurism, the claim to fame and the urge of being the center of attention.A lot of those themes check out but are overall underwhelming as a story. Like the cinematographer that goes for the money shot, we get the message yes, does it make for good drama? Not really. Faceless TMZ reporter should have been a deleted scene honestly, it does not add anything other than doubling down on the obvious social commentary.Especially the second half drags because of the heavy-handedness of said themes. I was hoping this movie was more like the 1988 film The Blob: more gruesome and unforgiving for the good guys. This movie lacks a good gut punch. The third act kind of deflates and the victory of the snapshot is again thematically resonant but as a climax it left me pretty cold. I also wished it would have left the monster and it's modus operandi more vague.Nonetheless I did enjoy most of the movie. I respect that it's at least an original take on a well trodden genre even tbough logically it doesn't make much sense. Watching it on the big screen was definitely worth it. Recommended for people who like great cinematography. Everyone else should not expect too much story wise.\"},\n",

Nice to see this as I feel we don't see this relationship highlighted often. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer absolutely nailed that dynamic. The whole cast is fantastic. I loved them all. But the MVP's for me were Keke Palmer and Brandon Perea. Loved both of them here. Emerald was hilarious and fun but also a bit complex. Angel was great as well. Loved his vibe. Yeun and Wincott were good as well. With OJ, Kaluuya often had to do a lot of face/body acting because of the quietness of the character which was fantastic. Another aspect of the film that was cool was the cinematography and the location. Loved the setting of the film being at a ranch with a lot of the focus on the sky as well.

Almost nothing happens for the first hour, and nothing is satisfyingly resolved in the second.The hero seems somnolent and depressive, slouching sleepily through scenes that should be dramatic, muttering his dialogue. His sister, by contrast, is hyper and voluble and seems to be channeling Butterfly McQueen. They're likable enough, but their speech is uneducated and difficult to understand -- which makes it all the more improbable that they represent a family that, at least in the past, supposedly ran a highly successful business.These discordant elements never gel.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I greatly enjoyed Get Out and loved US, both allegories of sorts. Very clever.With his third major outing, I was very much looking forward to watching what Jordan Peele and team had come up with.It's an intriguing premise. The idea is sound and there are some very interesting scenes in there.The problem is that it's all disjointed. Nothing is there to glue things together. There are many obvious questions being asked by viewers which we have to infer the answers to and even after that, the viewer will no doubt go......really?Characters just decide the solution rather than piecing things together to come up with them. That's the way it comes across.This could have been a spectacular film. The central idea is very good and the inclusion of Jupe's storyline was intriguing.....but those things shown were for nowt.I'm sure if someone explained it to me I would get why Jupe's storyline is even relevant to this film. In fact, his storyline, expanded, would have been a better story. But it just flittered away. Just seemed completely pointless to even include that.There are characters who do not know each other and by halfway are best of friends.No police are shown. Police tape exists.Just stuff like that. The editing has been too heavy handed.Even when at the end, the whole point of what they are trying to achieve is about to take fruition, one asks the question, where's your phone? Can't you do what you are about to do from distance?All of it, by the end, to me, seemed like some homage to cinematography....with lots of ideas just tacked on one after another without coherence.It starts with lots of mystery and ends with a meh.Lot of hot air with no solid, cold substance.Such a pity, as this could have been something special but instead has turned out to be non sensical at best.It's not even scary. Was it meant to be horror?Who knows and frankly you shouldn't care.Watch it if you are a Peele fan (just to see how it fails) but bypass if you are not.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This was a really great movie theater going experience, and I'm gonna say it is quite on par with Jordan Peele's excellent debut film 'Get Out'. Peele really outdid himself here; this film is very ambitious in the level of creativity and how the whole thing was shot. 95% of the movie takes place in desert regions, and he makes really good use of the setting, especially during the night time scenes and the angles he uses to pan to the sky when building tension.Another thing that blew me away was the sound design; this film goes from very quiet and subtle to very loud and abrupt, and in such a way that it really makes you feel the dread or urgency that the characters are feeling. During those subtle moments, you nearly want to hold your breath... It is just that nerve Dash shredding. The performances from Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer add to that sense of being in that world with them. Brother - sister dynamic was so believable throughout the film.Speaking of performances, I'm hearing some commentary that Kaluuya was unemotional at times. I don't agree. Without going into spoilers, something happens at the beginning of the film that definitely affected the well-being of his character OJ throughout the remainder of it. I think his minimalist approach at times was necessary and intentional and actually adds to the depths of his character. He wasn't over-the-top dramatic ever, but showed restraint during the first two-thirds while proving what range he really has in the third act of the film.. Another amazing performance and he is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors currently working.Now to actually comment on the plot and horror elements of the film, just know that this is a film you have to have patience with. Like all good stories it takes time to develop and build so be prepared to take this ride with the main characters and go into it with an open mind. This is very much a family - centric drama for a good portion of the movie. It doesn't go straight into the otherworldly stuff, or the scares... It's about a family's life and relationship. When the horror does kick in, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised because the film takes a bit of an unexpected turn from what you might think is really going on. It reminded me of the movie Signs a little bit, in the way it was set up and the suspense that it conveyed, but halfway through the film is where that Jordan Peele spectacular magic comes in heavy and man, he really went all out here. This film isn't about anything other than bringing Something new and fresh to sci-fi and horror. It takes elements from a genre that we've all seen before but truly does make them fresh, fun and original.I don't wanna say anymore than that because I don't want to give away spoilers, but if you like Jordan Peeles work and are interested in seeing a creative new movie, check out Nope. Just make sure you see it in the theater to appreciate all the work that went into it. It really is top notch and continues to show Peele's talent.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Nope is a neo-Western science fiction horror film about two horse-wrangling siblings who encounter a mysterious UFO over their ranch. The film is written, directed, and produced by Jordan Peele, who previously made the acclaimed films Get Out and Us. The film stars Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as the main protagonists, along with Steven Yeun, Barbie Ferreira, Jesse Plemons, and Michael K. Williams. The film explores themes of identity, history, memory, and trauma through a complex and surreal narrative that defies genre conventions.I loved this film. I thought it was a brilliant and original vision that kept me on the edge of my seat. I was amazed by the performance of Kaluuya and Palmer, who had great chemistry and charisma as the sibling duo. I also enjoyed the performance of Yeun, who played a mysterious stranger who joins them on their quest. I thought the film was well-written and directed. It had a captivating and unpredictable plot that surprised me at every turn. The film had a stunning visual style that created a contrast between the natural beauty of the desert landscape and the unnatural horror of the UFO. The film also had a haunting soundtrack that featured songs by Exuma , a cult Bahamian artist whose music inspired Peele. The film made me think about the stories that are hidden or erased from history, and how they can resurface in unexpected ways.'},\n",

If Peele's message was that the human desire to profit off of life's circumstances can often have disastrous results, then this movie delivers, but in a slow and ultimately disappointing manner. Was it worth watching ? Yes, if you've got nothing else to do and want to kill some time, only because of the fine acting by the leads and the somewhat ludicrous but fascinating subplot of a monkey gone berserk on a television series set.

It almost feels like Jordan intentionally wants to be the only person that comprehends the entire scope of the story and tries to be cool by leaving trinkets but it fails to deliver.However unlike Hitchcock or Spielberg whom both make sure you enjoy the ride with them - this time Jordan is the solitary.voyeur and the majority of the audience was left scratching their heads and some even left the theatre.The ufo/creature was extremely well done until the last supposed butterfly climax that one either enjoys or laughs at the silly cgi that looks more like a giant expanding flying kite. I found it quite silly.Regardless kudos for the effort and the acting and DP work is phenomenal but I must admit I'm getting tired of Daniel not having any expressions visible which makes one wonder if his sense of fear is only looking stone faced.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Aside from the great performances by all the actors, this movie gets a big NOPE! So pretentious and lame. The CGI monkey scene reminded me of the infamous Joker scene, except instead everything just went wrong. The plot \"twist\" felt like a typical Shyamalan move. Boring. And overused. Nothing new. And I keep wondering if they spent all the budget on bad CGI or why they never really left the horse ranch. And in the end, the movie leaves all the questions about the plot unanswered. Very unsatisfying. I would give this experience 2/10 stars only because of the actors and cinematography. Seeing the movie in IMAX was good, but it would have been even better if the movie was really good.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This movie is not very good, which is unfortunate given that I thought Us (2019) and Get Out (2017) were both very good. Those movies have a lot of depth to them and make rewatching them a blast, you want to learn more about them and discover new things you missed during your first viewing. I have no desire to revisit this movie. Peele has gotten some truly incredible perhaps even Oscar worthy performances from his leads in his previous movies (Kaluuya, Nyong'o, Allison Williams to name a few). Which is why it is so disappointing to see such flat performances from Kaluuya and Palmer in this movie. To be fair, the script doesn't do their characters much good. They are motivated by their family's legacy and how that is tied to their father's ranch and trade. Yet the movie gives me little reason to care with the imminent alien invasion taking precedence.I also fail to see what the scenes with the monkey have to do with the rest of the movie. I googled it and found an explanation from Peele but his perspective fails to explain their presence in the context of the rest of the film.I'd also like to mention that the design of the alien life form is very stupid looking. It looks like a random amalgamation of CGI, I can't imagine we will look back on this creature as some kind of iconic movie monster.Lastly this film is just way too long. The movie drags hard in the second act and the payoff is not worth the over 2 hour runtime.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"This was a film I was excited for 2022 releases. Since I avoid trailers, I just saw the poster and that was it. It was enough for know that it was the new Jordan Peele film. I couldn't catch this during its opening week, but I did avoid spoilers. The buzz that I heard was mostly positive so that helped. Jaime also came to see this with me in the theater.Synopsis: the residents of a lonely gulch in inland California bear witness to an uncanny and chilling discovery.For this movie, we start with a sitcom. We will learn this is from the 1990s. It had a gimmick of having a family living with a chimpanzee. The problem is that it goes crazy, killing most everyone on the show. Shifting to present day, we follow OJ Haywood (Daniel Kaluuya). We learn that his family is Hollywood royalty. Little known fact is that his ancestor was in the first motion picture which was a Black man on a horse. He works on a ranch where they train horses for movies. His father is Otis Haywood Sr. (Keith David). Tragedy strikes the family with an unexplained event.There is then a time jump. OJ brings a horse by the name of Lucky to a commercial shoot. What I like here is that we see he's quiet. I wouldn't necessarily say he's shy, but he isn't a fan of talking in front of a large group of people. He leaves that to his sister, Emerald (Keke Palmer). She is late, but also the life of a room.Things don't go as planned and the commercial decides to go a different direction. This forces OJ to sell this horse to a nearby tourist attraction. It is run by Ricky 'Jupe' Park (Steven Yuen). OJ's plan is to loan it, but we see that might be what his counterpart is doing. What is interesting here is that Jupe was the boy on the television show where the chimp went crazy. He tells all about it to Emerald. We can see that during this, OJ just wants to do business and get out of there.Back on their farm, we see that the sibling's relationship is strained. She is helping when she can, but her heart isn't in it. OJ is making tough decisions to save the business. Things all change when another of their horses get out and something happens. I'm not going to spoil it, but what I will say is that what happens is otherworldly. Our duo sees a chance to make money. What they go through is going to be much more life changing.That is where I'll leave my recap for this movie since I don't want to give away what happens. What I've given should give you an idea of our characters as well. Where I want to start is something I've already brought up and that is the writer/director of Peele. I'm not trying to play my hand too early, but he is three for three for me with his movies. This is my least favorite, but that isn't a slight. I think that Get Out is a masterpiece and Us isn't too far behind. What he did here is probably the most approachable though and might have more mainstream appeal than Us.Where I'll go then is the entity in this movie. I'm assuming most everyone who is reading this knows that it is aliens. That is the extent of what I'll say outside of that I've heard some say that the title is an acronym. I knew this coming in and supposedly it means Not of Planet Earth. Regardless, I like that despite leaning into science fiction, Peele was able to ground this. We get a glimpse of this sitcom to start before meeting our main family. This is an encounter movie without going too far over your head with the science there. I like that it plays with conventions as well. I've heard a podcast compare Peele to M. Night Shyamalan with this being the former's Signs. What is funny there is they share subject matter. There is a section of this that has similar scenes as well. We also have another character, Angel Torres (Brandon Perea), point out that the Pentagon confirmed in real life that there are extraterrestrials. That gets incorporated here. This goes in a different direction that I love. The poster also makes sense as you watch this.I think now I want to start delving a bit under the surface. Where I want to start is with this sitcom I've brought up. There is a tragedy here and Jaime questioned by it was here. Something I heard on another podcast was that this event shaped Ricky. It makes him overconfident and believe that he knows how to deal with what we get here. It fits in with something that happens later in his life. I took it in a different direction. This explores the idea of predators. What I told Jaime was that the chimp that lost its mind is like a predator. Looking them in the eye is a form of a challenge to them. This comes into play later. There is also a director, Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott), who we see editing footage of predators attacking. He has insight into them which I liked.Since I'm about animals, I'll go over to some social commentary. I think this movie is pointing out how animals are treated past and present in the film industry. Today it is much better, I will say that. Part of the explanation I have is that the chimp was at the end of what it could take so it attacked. There is a sad part for me that OJ is selling the horses that don't get the jobs in the industry. I'd say there's also a commentary on capitalism that when you no longer are useful, you are sold off. It is quite sad to be honest.The last bit of commentary before I move on would also deal with a subject that I know is important to Peele. It is the historical significance of Black people in the film industry. The moving picture they show is real. That is actual first one made and exhibited. The movie takes liberties with who that person is from what I'm guessing. I can work with that regardless. Peele is doing a great job at making movies with black leads and helping to solidify their place in modern cinema. I'm there for that.Where I'll then go is to the acting. Coming into this, I heard how good Palmer was. I will agree that she plays the character of Emerald in a quirky way. It works to play off Kaluuya as her quieter brother. I personally think that he's the better performance. He does so much without talking and just has a presence. Palmer was a bit too manic, but I won't take anything away from her. I thought that Perea was good in support. Wincott, Yeun, David and Oz Perkins were as well. The acting was good across the board. They all bring their characters to life.That will then bring me to the filmmaking aspects. Where I want to start here would be with the cinematography. This is Peele's biggest budget today and it looks great. The cinematography of the gulch this takes place in is amazing. What he does there is just beautiful. Shifting this to the effects, I thought they were also good. There is CGI here, but I couldn't see issues with it. I'm also sure there are practical ones mixed in which were solid. The other part would be the soundtrack. This is something else that Peele does masterfully well. What sticks out most is the use of Sunglasses at Night by Corey Hart. He slows it down and makes it eerie. The sound design is great as well. We can hear screams at different times that are unnerving. I think with this is what puts it in the horror genre for me. There are people question its place there, but my anxiety was up throughout most of this movie. I think there is enough to include it in horror.In conclusion, even though this is my least favorite of Peele's movies, which isn't a slight, this is still good. We get a story we've seen before, but he does something different with it. The acting is good across the board. I like what he did with the cinematography and the sound design as well as musical selections. The CGI we get works. I also like the commentary, even though this is the lightest of his movies. Peele is just an expert writer and makes interesting movies. I'm looking forward to revisiting before my year end roundup.My Rating: 8 out of 10.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Peele seems to have a talent for making a movie that is 3/4ths of the way to being great, but never seeming to be able to get past that final 1/4th.I enjoyed Nope, a movie that doesn't fit nicely into any one genre, but channels well aspects of several, but it could have been so much better.I thought the two main actors, Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, made some decisions with their characters that detracted from them instead of improving what was on the page. Does Kaluuya understand that he has a face that can make expressions? I've never seen an actor who so entirely has decided his face isn't part of his acting. Palmer brings a brash obnoxiousness to her character that detracts from the audience's care for her.The movie underutilizes Stephen Yeun, the strongest actor in the cast, but his times on the screen are engaging and entertaining.There is a funny jab at TMV at one point that, while humorous, was so ham-fisted that it took me out of the movie for a while. There were also some confusing aspects of the protagonists plans on combating the antagonists.I know I'm coming across pretty harshly, but I did enjoy the movie overall. I think the reason I'm so harsh with Peele is because he gets so close to creating great movies, but hasn't gotten there yet. I think he can and I look forward to his next attempt.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This is the type of film that deliberately drags out a revelation. What happened on the set of the comedy show? The camera slowly tracks to reveal a detail. That deliberate kind of loitering was very common in M. Knight Shyalaman films. The other element that resembles a Shyamalan film are the quirky characters. Then there are the oddball deaths. David Lynch films feature oddball deaths as well. Reviews harkened Spielberg and his approach to showing aliens. It could be Shyamalan was influenced by Spielberg, and Peele took his notes from Shyamalan\\'s interpretation of Spielberg.Nonetheless, the approach to making this science fiction thriller had potential, but also takes too much time for some of the reveals. I was a little shocked that this slowly paced film clocked in over two hours. There is a rhythm that audiences are used to, including thrillers. They want the story resolved in a timely manner. The third act in this film drags way too long to reach the ultimate resolution.What both Spielberg and Shyamalan used as a device was the depiction of an everyday situation being subverted in some way. A horse suddenly runs away. A woman lies dead on a TV set. A tourist amusement park is strewn with debris. The movie opens with a tease of \"something\\'s not right\", and tries to maintain that type of suspense for most of the long running time. For the most part it succeeds, but doesn\\'t stick the landing. If the pacing was tightened up a bit, and some of the repetition in the third act eliminated, you could have had yourself a real tense movie.So, comparing this to something like \"Signs\" or \"The Happening\", there is about the same amount of intrigue combined with moments of \"huh?\". Sometimes those \"huh?\" moments don\\'t work. Nevertheless the acting and story succeed, keeping my interest for the most part.6 out of 10.'},\n",

There have been places saying that it was visually stunning even though the story is slow but i can totally say that this isnt the case. District 9 had better CGI for the giant Alien this was and weird white blob that the final form is one of the worst designs i\\'ve seen.Possibly the first act is the best of making the movie being a science fiction horror film but it just got stupid and actually came to a conclusion (much like Get Out and Us) halfway through the film where i honestly thought thank god thats finished... nope we have another half an hour to stupidity. Where Get out was a phycological horror movie, Us was a Slasher horror and this is meant to be the Alien one but totally misses the point. I idea of this would have been closer to Alien 1979 but was closer to the blog that just become funny by the end of it.Overall in my opinion Jordan Peeles horror bubble might have burst after 3 movies as this was a terrible movie.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Nope! A long, drawn out affair that really makes you feel its 2 hour 10 minute runtime as it slowly plods along like the lead OJ seems to throughout the movie.The film tries to be deep and wants the audience to consider the concept of it being a 'spectacle' (both visually and literally) but wastes so much time in trying to achieve this (ie Gordy / Jupe scenes) it actually takes away from the actual spectacle of there being a UFO using their farm as its personal hunting grounds.Most of the performances are both mumbling and understated which by contrast makes Steven Yeun's performance seem OTT and Keke Palmer is just annoying from the outset. Daniel Kaluuya'sBut where this movie really falls down is in all of the plot holes and lazy choices it seems to generate throughout the movie. This is particularly frustrating as the film spends a lot of time setting the parameters of the experience only to drop them when they don't fit into a particular scene. This happens moreso when the final act tries to wrap everything up as quickly as possible.The bits with the flags is cheap, as is the idea of eye contact making the entity attack - something which is used loosely throughout - which is a shame as Daniel Kaluuya use of looking & observing is one of the elements which did work really well.So is this a good movie ... Nope!\"},\n",

The average should have been 2 or less because this movie is one of the worst movies I\\'ve ever seen. It is about as goo as the low budget Sci-Fi channel original films (Sharknado comes to mind).There is absolutely no coherence in the story, and the editing is horrible. The director tries so hard to create a plot twist, but he failed miserably. He should have realized that he could not have made a plot twist because the movie does NOT have a plot to begin with. The entire plot is a nonsensical rambling with no coherent story or message. Jordon Peele reminds me of Night Shyamalan who has been perpetually failing to replicate his first and only success -- Six Sense.Other than the poor story, directing and editing, I also found the acting quite underwhelming to say the least. Daniel Kaluuya seemed like a depressed person with no desire to live. All the characters are seriously cliched, and their behaviors were incongruent. It was truly painful to watch their acting.I will not start talking about the alien concepts and the ridiculous connection to connect it to animal behavior because its premise is so ridiculous that it doesn\\'t even deserve any mentioning.Please do yourself a favor, and do NOT watch this movie.

Things that should be subtle subtext are core aspects of the film and they just aren't that interesting. So when he sets the trailer up as a horror/UFO story, yet the film is really about something else, it just becomes a poorly made horror film that is a huge letdown to the audience. The pacing is so slow that by the time the UFO thing shows up, it feels more like Sharknado than a serious horror film. Peele needs to focus on telling a good story FIRST.Same thing happened to M. Night after The Sixth Sense. He started believing the rumors that he was the next Spielberg and getting this big head about what a genius he was, next thing you know, his movies suffered. He forgot how to entertain an audience and wanted to stand on his soapbox handing out his social commentary. Peele has talent, but he needs to get over this student film amateur hour and realize that people go to the movies for good stories and entertainment. If you want to see what a good horror film looks like, go enjoy The Black Phone.\"},\n",

I think Jordan Peele was trying to do way too much with this movie and was trying way too hard to display his artistic ingenuity and failed miserably.

Perhaps I was disappointed in this movie with how successful and cryptic Us and Get Out were but this movie made me lose all faith in Peele as a writer and director. Men In Black as a comedy and sci-fi movie blows this one out of the water. The best element of this movie is perhaps the music. The acting is decent but you aren\\'t going to want to watch this movie purely for the acting. There are no memorable scenes, lines, quotes, or themes in this movie and I feel maybe I just missed something but I really don\\'t think so. I wouldn\\'t mind getting my two hours back and I am very glad I watched the movie at home for free but instead of \"Nope,\" the film should be titled \"WTF?\" because you will be incredibly let down, I guarantee it.

That\\'s truly disappointing because a bit more effort spent on the mixing (scriptwriting) and direction (baking) could have produced something worth consuming.The thing is that \"Nope\" contains a few great ideas around UFOs and how they might manifest. The setup is nicely handled and the actors are more than capable. The elements of an excellent horror/sci-fi film are undoubtedly here.But it all goes a bit wayward in the second half. Story arcs that seem irrelevant get in the way and they never resolve. The actions of the main characters start to make less and less sense.

And thankfully peele strikes gold yet again with this suspenseful sci-fi thriller that's probably his most ambitious yet. It's pretty stellar how he takes a concept as old as the 1950s and turns it into something original & his own. Think of this movie like his version of Jaws. The cinematography was breathtaking and has some of the best night shots I've seen in a movie in awhile. The cast do an excellent job with both humorous and heartfelt moments throughout.My only issue is a subplot involving a chimp that I won't spoil. It's a pretty horrendous scene and I get how it fits into the movie's theme of how we sometimes grossly monetized tragedy, but I think that theme couldve been executed without the scene which goes on longer than needed. Still NOPE is quite a spectacle that I can't recommend enough for you to give a shot.\"},\n",

OJ & Emerald discover something truly terrifying.Nope is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Jordan Peele gives us another thrilling & one of a kind movie. His previous directorial efforts, Get Out(2017) & Us(2019) are true masterpieces. This film comes really close but, falls slightly short. The reason for this is, there's no massive twist in Nope. The plot is pretty straightforward. It's not as scary as Get Out(2017) & Us(2019). The set pieces are awe-inspiring. The background score by Michael Abels is memorable. Peele has truly given us a movie worthy of a big screen(preferably IMAX), during this never-ending pandemic. Daniel Kaluuya is outstanding as OJ Haywood. Keke Palmer is spectacular as Emerald Haywood. Brandon Perea is fantastic as Angel Torres. Steven Yeun is brilliant as Ricky 'Jupe' Park. The supporting cast is excellent. Nope is a must watch for sci-fi/thriller & Jordan Peele fans. Just lower your expectations, a tiny bit. Watch it on the biggest screen possible. Can't wait for Jordan Peele's next film!\"},\n",

Even from the spectacular success of Get Out, Jordan Peele has come a very long way. He no longer has to prove himself to audiences. He's an established name in horror and to that effect, he's able to take more risks with the films he's making next. Nope and it's narrative is so freewheeling, it's exhilarating to watch. It has all the time in the world to tell its story and that story is wonderfully unpredictable. Like all the great horror classics, Peele leaves you on the edge of your seat, as you know to expect the unexpected. What terrors await us in the sky? Is it a flying saucer, or something even stranger? Nope runs on its momentum for the greater amount of its runtime. Matched by that is its pitch perfect, killer cast. Keke Palmer is a an absolute revelation. This woman is made for the movies. But, I'm afraid to say that the film concludes in a rather anti-climactic way. By that, I mean that when the menacing evil in the sky is fully revealed, it leaves so much to be desired. One man's opinion.

It's a gorgeous looking film with amazing lighting, and great camera direction. Speaking of direction, Peele has definitely mastered directing tension as the film has many scenes filled with great tension. The performances too are also fantastic. Daniel Kaluuya is really good in the movie, but Keke Palmer is the standout. She is hilarious and truly amazing. All of the acting is really well done. The visuals are also really good, and the message that this film is presenting about crew on movies is something different and commendable. And finally the story overall is just really interesting. It's simple which I liked.Now there are some things I'm a little mixed on. For staters the movie feels a little too long. It did feel like it dragged a bit and could've had maybe 10 or 15 minutes cut out. There's a character in the movie who has a tragic backstory, but they don't fully do much with it as this character isn't really in the film that long, and finally the final 20 minutes of the movie felt very different from the rest and the ending felt very abrupt.Overall despite the film dragging at times, Nope is a admirable effort from Jordan Peele with great performances, amazing cinematography, and an interesting story filled with some great tension.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Firstly I will state that I don\\'t normally write reviews but after seeing the amount of negative reviews from people who clearly do not get the subject matter, I feel the need to speak up in hopes that I can sway others into giving it a chance.Yes the movie does start a little slow, it doesn\\'t fit the classic \"horror/thriller movie\" category, and it doesn\\'t answer all your questions nicely at the end, but if you can go in with an open mind, you will be rewarded.There is a ton of symbolism and hidden meanings to this film just like Get Out & Us had, but I feel it is not as \"on the nose\" as those films, which is causing others to reject it, but that\\'s exactly what I believe Peele wants. He doesn\\'t want to give you the easy answers here and if you can accept that, this movie will make your mind race. Like he said in an interview, it\\'s what the audience doesn\\'t know that keeps them compelled, which is why this movie had hype in the first place.Without spoiling anything, this movie is what you make it and can be looked at from several different angles. We live in a day and age where films will lazily leave the audience with open ended & answerless endings in hopes for us to fill in the blanks, but here we are tasked with reflect, which is not always easy for us humans to do.Overall, it\\'s not a movie for everyone but it\\'s also worth a try, don\\'t listen to these reviews. Don\\'t look up.'},\n",

What he's crafted here is essentially Jaws: a man vs monster film that focuses as much on the characters as the titular monster. The mystery of Spielberg's film is fully present, though tonally Peele is much more at home with his down to earth black leads and their modern social problems.It's not all great though. There are a few plot segways that either don't resolve or are underdeveloped. Peele seems to need to justify certain characters aspirations, as if the situation at hand isn't onus enough. The ending sequences are also more bumpy than the lead up; Peele ups the pace, sometimes with less than stellar results.I can understand the somewhat divisive reviews. Adventure isn't always action packed and there is a fair bit of theory crafting where some people would like more scares. For me this is Jordan Peele's most mature, exciting movie.\"},\n",

First, glossing over OJ\\'s realization the alien only consumes/eats those looking at it, it\\'s mentioned again and goes into their strategy to \"get the shot.\" Especially since the protagonists are still solely focused on capturing the creature, including symbolic luddite OJ. Secondly, the chimpanzee. The subplot was confusing and didn\\'t really fit, I kept trying to connect the alien and chimp, and fell short. Jupe\\'s character and park definately added to the story but it felt like he was bringing in a 2nd theme that could\\'ve been done in a better way beside the chimp, especially with the shoe and mysterious vibes behind it.'},\n",

Daniel Kaluuya is once again absolutely amazing in his role, this man never disappoints and Nope (2022) just solidifies this! Keke Palmer was loveable and hilarious as Emerald, her and Kaluuya had so much chemistry. Also, I have to hand it to Steven Yeun, he didn't have much screen time but his character felt so in-depth and Yeun plays him perfectly!The cinematography and visuals in this film were some of Peele's most impressive yet. The colour schemes were brooding, setting the mood so well. Not to mention, the visual effects were amazing all throughout and were genuinely super creepy!Something I always love in Peele's films is the sound design and score, this film isn't any different. The sound design was so effective, and gave me chills at times! It set an incredibly ominous atmosphere. Also, the soundtrack was great too, and was used tastefully.The pacing of the film was great, I never found myself getting bored and I was fully immersed during every scene. The way the different sub-plots unfold along with the main plot included some amazing narrative techniques and really added to the meaning of the film.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'My first impression of \"Nope,\" was a modern day equivalent to cult B-list horror movies such as Tremors, or Lake Placid. I read a lot of reviews before the movie, and I didn\\'t know what to expect. I left satisfied, but not WOWed. The cinematography was appealing and expertly stylized, the actors were phenomenal, and it was entertaining, but I wasn\\'t 100% sure what all the story lines had to do with one another! One day later I pieced it all together, and my opinion of the film completely changed.What at first seems like a cinematic mash up of several genres, which for the sake of entertainment, could be considered somewhat successful, is really a highly cohesive commentary on the exploitation of animals for entertainment, and the perils of underestimating the brute power of nature.The film opens with an off-screen sound bite from a sitcom filming gone wrong. The sitcom opens with a birthday party scene for title character/family member, \"Gordy\" the chimp. A loud bang ensues (which we later learn is a helium balloon popping), and as a result Gordy attacks the cast. The scene opens to reveal the set of the show, and the bloodied, terrified monkey, who proceeds to resume his attack on the injured cast, pause, and turn to face the camera, breaking the 4th wall. This narrative has received the most negative attention from reviewers, but in fact, sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Breakaway, Nope begins. We are on a horse ranch in California run by the Haywood family, who specialize in horse training/handling for the film industry. Our main character, OJ (no, not that OJ), is quickly witness to his father\\'s death via freak accident, a strange hail storm of metallic objects falling from the sky, and written off as a cargo plane accident. In the subsequent scenes we are introduced to OJ\\'s dynamic sister, Emerald Haywood, played to perfection by Keke Palmer, and expert filmographer Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott).We are also introduced to Jupe Park, played by Walking Dead famous Steven Yeun. Jupe runs a small-time theme park neighbouring the Haywood farm, and is revealed to have been a former child star. In fact, the same child who starred on the ill-fated set of the Gordy show, and witnessed the massacre that ended the sitcom\\'s run. Jupe and OJ have a business relationship, wherein OJ sells horses to Jupe for his attractions/shows in order to keep his failing family farm afloat. OJ indicates that he might be in a position to start to buy back some of his horses, and Jupe vaguely deflects the conversation.... this seems small but is important.After a somewhat laborious set up, we are finally \"officially\" introduced to the villain of the film... an unidentified flying object (aka. UFO) focused on the seeming abduction of the Haywood farm horses. OJ witnesses this strange occurrence and quickly appraises his sister of the situation. Ever the millennial hustler stereotype, Emerald is quick to subside her horror in favour of profit. The siblings agree to extend all of their finances in order to achieve a lucrative \"shot\" of the UFO, securing themselves financially. Obviously a trip to Best Buy (though in the flick it\\'s called something else), is in order. This is where we are introduced to techy dream boat/casual alien enthusiast, Angel Torres (Brandon Perea). Angel quickly becomes part of the Haywood gang, hell bent on capturing video footage of this phenomenon for profit.Breakaway to Jupe\\'s theme park, where we learn that not only is Jupe aware of this extraterrestrial presence, but he is in fact actively baiting this entity with the horses he is buying from the Haywood farm, as a means of creating an attraction for his business. Decked out in full western regalia, adorned with UFOs in rhinestones, Jupe treats his audience of 40 people to a spectacle unseen before... a true alien encounter. Jupe is able to schedule these shows by releasing the horses as \"bait,\" and therefore believes he has \"trained\" the vessel, prime for capitalization. However, the encounter goes awry, and after the baited horse refuses to leave his paddock, the entire audience and staff are \"sucked up\" by the alien entity.This is where the script flips. The members of the audience are not being abducted, they are being eaten. The alien vessel is not a vessel at all, but an extraterrestrial life form.OJ witnesses the event, and is able to escape and rescue his horse, Lucky, in the process. With his newfound understanding of the entity, OJ is able to use his knowledge and respect of animals to put aside his monetary motivations for capturing the creature on film, and subsequently save his family and farm.This is where I\\'m leaving off this review, because it\\'s already full of spoilers, and truly the rest is inconsequential.NOPE is genius.What at first glance comes across as randomness and pastiche, is actually a well crafted narrative. The message is subtle and lingering, but consistent once defined. Packaged with tons of personality and style, it\\'s a movie that can be consumed for entertainment value or intellectual provocation, and for that I gave it a 9!'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\"Nope\" starts with a powerful scene that leaves no doubt that it will be a good movie. Jordan Peele returns with an excellent production led by a good script written by himself. The film offers a different perspective on UFOs and aliens, starting with a metaphor about animals and their unpredictable behavior, first with a chimpanzee and later it adds a paradox with domesticated horses that tie in perfectly with the plot and then presents something new in the science fiction and horror genres. \"Nope\" also pays homage to genre classics like the sci-fi flick \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and horror like \"Jaws.\" The main characters are brilliantly written, all of them with a well-structured background, as well as including variations between an interracial cast and with progressive elements that do not become forced. The performances are good, highlighting that of Keke Palmer. The digital special effects are masterfully achieved, with an avant-garde design. The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is beautiful in the exterior locations and gloomy in the interiors, as well as still frames that are powerful for the eyes. Michael Abels\\' music is tremendous, reminiscent of the musical works of John Williams. Short of being a masterpiece, \"Nope\" turns out to be an excellent film and a worthy candidate for next year\\'s Academy Awards.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Is the title somewhat hyperbolic? Yes. But this film fills me with rage, I\\'m going to split this review into two halves, the first half will be spoiler free, the second more nit picky and with some minor spoilers.Part 1.I like the cast, not all of them, but the majority. I think Daniel Kaluuya is the strongest, his performance is reserved but it gets the message across, I think Steven Yeun does well with what he is given, not much, and I think Keke Palmer is likeable enough. Sadly, while the performances are for the most part decent, there is woefully little character development. The characters all just sort of, don\\'t change. I guess maybe some of them grow closer but no one really learns much. I think the whole script is weak, there are multiple storylines which, while relevant to each other, fail to come together in a satisfying way. The dialogue as well is just lazy at points, really cookie cutter formulaic lines, most notably I think from Michael Wincott, who plays a world renowned cinematographer. Talking of cinematography, I think that was hit and miss too. There are some good shots but very little feels creative, and some shots just come off as lazy. Do I think that this film would be doing nearly as well if it wasn\\'t for that fact it has a big name director? No. Not at all. I think that Jordan Peele may be, dare I say it, overrated. I haven\\'t seen Get Out but I hear it\\'s brilliant. I don\\'t doubt that. But I have seen Us. It has a strong first and second act but the third act throws away a lot of the tension that has been built. This film however, never manages to build any tension to throw away. While there are good ideas it struggles to know what to do with them and feels woefully under baked.Now I would like to nit pick.Part 2.(Minor Spoilers)This film is so dumb and I hate that I can\\'t say that. There are metaphors at play, I understand that, but here\\'s my counterpoint. I don\\'t care. I shouldn\\'t have to finish the film and watch a breakdown plus read multiple dissections to understand why everything is the way it is. Before you call me lazy and tell me that Jordan Peele is trying to make us think. Stop. I get it. I like films where you can gain a deeper appreciation of the themes by doing more in depth research, but that is to gain a deeper appreciation. Not to get any semblance of appreciation. Clever filmmakers allow you to work things out throughout the film, not in the car after on your phone. Also. This film is not scary. I\\'ve seen people saying that there are different types of horror, \"Horror isn\\'t just jump scares, sometimes it\\'s more drawn out suspense.\". Ummm. Did you forget about the jump scares in this film? That were lazy and predictable? Also this film is not suspenseful either. And not scary. The digestion scenes? Look like the inside of a car wash. The chimpanzee scenes? They would have been scarier if they actually fit in with the plot. Instead I was trying to work out why they were relevant. And don\\'t you dare tell me that it is relevant because it shows Steven Yeun can tame an animal and is a comparison to the later events. I GET IT. THAT DOESN\\'T STOP THEM FEELING OUT OF PLACE AND FORCED. You\\'re telling me there was no way that Peele could have worked these ideas into the plot in a more organic way? Also they aren\\'t even all that similair. The chimpanzee is being held captive, away from his natural environment, in horrible conditions and the alien? It\\'s being fed and used for entertainment sure. But it\\'s not held captive, it does as it pleases. It\\'s just chilling and having the occasional free meal. Also the chimpanzee get\\'s set off by the loud noise of the balloon popping. Not being looked in the eyes. So no, the shoe balancing is not the reason that young Yeun survives, because he is preoccupied and not having a staring contest with Gordy. The reason he survives is plot armour. Also those inflatable wiggly men, let\\'s talk about those. You\\'re telling me that the tech genius guy, who is such a lazy character, has no better way of knowing when the electricity is down, than that. I get it, it\\'s pretty with the colours but it\\'s not genius and the alien. The number one rule of this kind of horror is not to show the creature till the end. Think Alien or Predator. These kind of things are so much scarier when we only get hints as to what they look like. So maybe don\\'t show them really early on in broad daylight. Especially if the design isn\\'t that great. I get how it is supposed to look like a UFO, and it\\'s a sort of twist. But it doesn\\'t make sense. You keep saying not to look it in the eyes when it has no discernible features. Should have called the film Don\\'t Look Up, and when it opens up into it\\'s final form. It makes even less sense. Plus why can you hear screams from it when it flys around? And how come they all cut out as one? Does it swallow people, wait a while and then release stomach acid? Where is the internal logic. My last little thing, it eats some horse statue, then just spits it out. And they say that it now recognizes that. The horse statue was all covered in little colourful flags. Now at the end, the balloon floats up, with colourful flags. And it hasn\\'t learnt a thing, just goes ahead and starts chowing down. Plus it try\\'s to eat it and IT pops, not the balloon? And what was going on with that cloud that never moved? Did it make the cloud? Was the cloud a coincidence? Was it the cloud? If it was the cloud then does that mean it stayed completely still while they were filming that cloud and then only moved when they stopped. I\\'m sorry, this film is just so nonsensical and I have so many questions. I don\\'t hate it. But it\\'s stupid and dumb and lazy. So stop acting like I just don\\'t get it and except that it has flaws. It is not a masterpiece, it is not the best film of the year, and if someone asked me whether they should watch this film. I would say Nope.'},\n",

In some aspects I applaud him for what he was able to achieve, but it's starting to feel like he's trying slightly too hard to conjure a film that impacts the industry as much as Get Out did. The story was ambitious, and he made a great decision hiring Hoytema as the cinematographer, but the needless Gordo subplot and Keke Palmers strenuous acting undercut the satisfying elements of the film. I also disagreed with several of Peele's creative decisions as he couldn't seem to piece together the individual positive qualities into a complete and absolute cinematic venture.

And since when can a Fry's check out clerk making minimum wage monitor cameras for you (or give a crap)?Another aspect is horses running off randomly. I've never seen a horse owner react with a shrug of their shoulders if their horse goes running off to the hills. It feels like whoever made this film has never actually done any research into basic care for horses on a ranch.The premise is different and interesting but connecting with the characters and the scene is difficult.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Nope is a new science fiction thriller directed, written and partly produced by Jordan Peele, the director of Get Out and Us.The film is about brother Oj (Daniel Kaluuya) and sister Emerald Haywood (Keke Palmer), who have to keep the family's horse ranch running after the death of their father Otis (Keith David).OJ and Emerald are certain that their father was killed by a mysterious fallen object from the sky. They suspect that this object may have come from a UFO and now they are trying to capture this UFO on video as evidence. They get help from the tech salesman Angel Torres (Brandon Perea) and the documentary filmmaker Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott).With this film, Jordan Peele has directed his third film and has changed genres for a change. His first two films were more horror films with some twists and turns and his third film has been turned into a science fiction film. The choice to switch genres is because Jordan Peele was inspired by other classic films of this genre. Unfortunately, thanks to this inspiration, he has copied many elements from these well-known films, so that this new film itself unfortunately does not bring out much unique.The film also has a long-winded build so you get to know the two main characters better, but too much time has been used for this. You already know what the brother and sister are like after about the first half hour, but they have unnecessarily chosen to let the build-up of the characters take about half an hour longer. The movie also has too many unnecessary characters that bring their own storylines. If Jordan Peele had brought out some lesser characters in the film, the film would have been a bit clearer.Despite the fact that the film cast contains too many characters, most of the actors do a good job in the film. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer come across as brother and sister, but they both have different personalities. Daniel Kaluuya plays a more calm and quiet person, while Keke Palmer's character has a more hyper and comedic personality. The rest of the cast have more smaller roles that not every actor gets the same amount of time. The bigger actors like Michael Wincott and Keith David have more of a cameo in the film. Brandon Perea and Steven Yeun play supporting roles, but the question is whether both actors were really needed in the front of the film. Without either of these two actors, the film could have been shorter and clearer.Together with photography director Hoyte Van Hoytema, Jordan Peele manages to portray the film beautifully. Hoyte Van Hoytema has provided a new film technique, which allows you to see filmed images in the dark night more clearly and in a beautiful way. In earlier science fiction or horror movies, night scenes were used more to provide more mystery, to bring out monsters or aliens in a first vague way. Although the UFO is also hidden in this film, you can now see more clearly where the UFO is located or where it is traveling to. This way they know how to create more tension, because in some scenes you can sometimes see the UFO moving in a hidden way if you pay attention. It's just a shame that these beautiful images of this unique way of filming are somewhat overshadowed by the long-winded and unclear sides of the rest of the story.\"},\n",

It\\'s fantastic in every way though, and I believe it solidifies Peele becoming the new Speilberg in a way. It\\'s not a perfect film, but it is certainly one of the years best so far. I was interesting and engrossed the whole way through. Music is great again here in Peeles work. Although \"Us\" is still my favorite Peele film this is a close 2nd with Get Out not far behind it. Peele is definitely a force to be reckoned with in the film industry. In a way, I\\'d say this is his Close Encounters with a bit Signs and some mild comedic elements to balance it out. Some great performances here too with some great scenes of dialogue. There is also a flashback story that ties in with a character that had me shook. Some of the mystery in this is great and I wish there could be more from this world. You will want a sequel, but if we need one is another story.'},\n",

Not looking at their watches. If the writer and director can't get it done in 90 minutes, then they ought to make drama's.The basics of this story could have easily been told within 90 minutes. A good portion of it could have been excised as it had little to nothing to do with the story. In fact, the entire backstory to Steven Yeun's character (involving a sitcom starring a trained monkey who goes rouge) could have been edited out. Also his character years later wanting to buy OJ's horse farm. All of that cut away. In fact the film could have started with the live show on his ranch! And from there involve OJ, his sister, the tech, and the re-known director.But no.Tons of dragging dialog did not help. OJ seemed to be on 24/7 sedatives while his sister was plain out annoying as all get out. I wanted the alien to get her so bad!

I quite liked Us it was very entertaining and had some interesting things to say about trauma. Nope's message is much more subtle, but I put forward that it regards the concept of spectacle and sensationalism which is something which dominates all of our forms of media these days, particularly social media, and the consequences of foregoing what is right and morality in pursuit of bigger spectacle. Again, Peele uses an entertaining and seemingly unrelated vehicle through which to explore this deeper subtext. This time round it is a sci-fi, horror, thriller vehicle. And the vehicle does look fantastic. I was not surprised to learn they used IMAX cameras, it really does look great and is perhaps worth the extra investment to see it on the big screen. As with his other two films though, I think he points to interesting concepts but doesn't have too much to say about them, he just asks questions. His thematic objectives are clearly important priorities for him, but remain subtle, and this is no different.\"},\n",

And then Nope comes out and you have an obnoxious Keke Palmer distracting from a fine performance by Daniel Kaluuya.The subplot with Steven Yeun being a child actor with a deranged chimpanzee also did not serve the plot of the film.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'The movie Nope (2022) is a great suspense thriller with unexpected moments and good characters to get behind. Director Jordan Peele made a suspenseful movie that raises questions about what is happening.Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer were both great in the movie. I liked their characters, and I liked knowing their story behind their horse ranch and what they do to keep it going.I will not spoil anything but the clues and weird things that happen from this mysterious entity can be suspenseful and disturbing. When it does show it made me nervous and I hoped that the characters would survive the encounter.There are a lot of effective scares or suspensefully disturbing scenes that had me at the edge of my seat. There was also nice cinematography with nice shots of the horse ranch and nice distant shots.I recommend going out to see this movie, because you will get an improved experience watching the movie in a theater. A great 3rd movie for director Jordan Peele.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Comedian turned virtuoso director and Oscar winner Jordan Peele has already proved himself to be a master of the horror genre, expertly interlacing thrills with hard-hitting social commentary to deliver smash hit films like \"Get Out (2017)\" and \"Us (2019)\". With \"Nope\", the director attempts his most ambitious project yet and passes with flying colors, giving us a stunningly original thriller that blends horror with sci-fi and leverages its talented cast to the fullest extent.Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer star as two fractious siblings trying to make ends meet with their struggling California ranch. The desert skies above them start behaving mysteriously and how they handle the sinister incidents that occur around them forms the rest of the story. In direct contrast to his earlier ventures, Peele relies more on visual spectacle and special effects here than his character\\'s performances to deliver scares and it pays off, with the desert\\'s emptiness and picturesque scenery playing into the nefarious environment the maker is trying to set up.Oscar-winner Kaluuya is expectedly full of nuanced brilliance in his portrayal while Keke Palmer is a surprise package, delivering a spunky take on her rebellious character of \"Emerald Haywood\". Steven Yuen, Michael Wincott and Brandon Perea excel in their supporting roles, with Peele continuing to prove that he has a talent for unearthing hidden talents and extracting the most from them.While not hitting the classic high notes of \"Get Out\", \"Nope\" is an elegant, finely structured and highly engaging addition to the growing Jordan Peele filmography, constantly surprising the viewer with its twists and turns. The director\\'s talent to instantly bewitch you with his intricate character studies and twisted plotlines combines this time with staggering visual effects to give an all-around thrilling experience.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Jordan Peele does it again! As the credits the roll, I was positively overwhelmed with Nope\\'s brand of horror & captivated by its storylines. Literally, I had my hand over my chest and screaming \"Damn, what a film!\".Peele\\'s details and ideas presented in Nope, were nothing short of genius. His themes were both original & horrifying, aided strongly by unpredictability that keeps the audience engaged & engrossed with what could happen next. His storyline & subplots were compelling, that they spark post-watch debates & scrutiny due to its perceived commentaries on capitalism, whitewashing & many forms of abuses in media. What is amazing is that all these, are presented in a frenetic pace that relishes mystery & suspense through increments of jaw dropping revelations.Technically, Nope is also Peele\\'s most visually impressive film. The cinematography was brilliant specially in scenes where eerie atmosphere is the name of the game. The sound design effectively amplify the horror as well, consistent with acclaimed predecessors, Us and Get Out.Overall, Nope simply transcends the sci fi horror genre. It is another strong outing from the mind of Jordan Peele that rivals Get Out as his best work. It takes the concept of \"fear of the unknown\" to a whole new terrifying level, while bringing to light awfulness in our society that we need to be reminded of. What an experience.'},\n",

It follows OJ (Kaluuya), his sister, Em (Palmer) & father Otis (David) as they try to run their Californian horse-training ranch. When some strange happenings occur, they bring in Angel (Perea) & Holst (Wincott) for help. Ricky (Yeun) is the neighbour trying to run a theme park. The mystery is revealed after ~45min and then the stakes are raised.No spoilers here, other than to say it's probably both what you might expect and also completely unexpected in parts. The film has a pretty good score and soundtrack, with a great use of light. There's a few good laughs and jumps, but nothing overly horrific.The three main actors are all good, but not exceptional - the character development wasn't really there. It could've been called 'Don't Look Up', but Adam McKay beat Pele to it! It's hard to put a finger on it, but there's just something missing which would've elevated this to another level. It's a good concept, but not flawlessly executed.\"},\n",

What also doesn't work are the actors in the film. No one interests me, for all I care they could be eaten by aliens after 3 minutes and the story would be over. First problem: Daniel Kaluuya. I have the feeling with him that he does nothing but traipse through a plot at a snail's pace. No facial expressions, no variations, for me his Oscar and his further nomination is more of a woke issue. I can't take either seriously. The other actors are no better, then comes the unbelievable: After the introductory images comes the alien moment, which I hoped would not happen. But unfortunately it determines the second half of the film, which doesn't get any better. The parallel story with the monkey? Doesn't bring any enlightenment. Yes, it deals with self-referential themes, but that's usually a sign that an author is trapped.

I didn't get the point of this movie till I googled what it all meant. I didn't feel entertained and the part that had me glued to the screen was the scene when the monkey mauled characters of a TV show. That was true horror for me. I felt that they really could have done something with the monkey instead of the aliens. The aliens were comical and the way they ate the people reminded me of a bounce house for children. It was unfortunate that I didn't like Keke's acting in this movie. I usually enjoy her work. Honestly, none of the characters were likable or enjoyable to watch. This movie was over two hours long and it could have been shortened by either concentrating on the monkey or the aliens. I would skip watching this movie because it does drag on. Even if the director wanted to show commentary of the media or whatever it still fell short for me. I believe this movie failed with the plot and characters. The cinematography was beautiful but that is it for this movie. I would not even bother. It is a nope from me.\"},\n",

Honestly, this is one of those rare titles that attracts the viewer. Culturally, \"nope\" is something we say when we\\'re not having it. \"Nope, I\\'m not doing this today.\" \"Nope, I\\'m not trying to die.\" \"Nope, I got better s**t to do with my time.\" That one word just says so much.In this sci-fi horror, a horse training family is visited by something extra-terrestrial. Very early in the movie the patriarch, Otis Haywood (Keith David), was killed by a nickel that fell from the sky and got embedded in his head. Otis and his son Otis Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya) trained horses for Hollywood. After Otis Sr. Died from that tragic and mysterious accident, the business was left in the hands of Otis Jr. Aka OJ. He was helped by his flighty and talkative sister, Emerald (Keke Palmer), but it was clear that the business was waning.When OJ witnessed something akin to a UFO he and his sister saw it as a potential payday. If they could get a quality video or picture of this thing, then maybe they could make some good money.All money ain\\'t good money.\"Nope\" took a while to really get going. It was slow and awkward to start with no established mood or direction. Of course, I was there to see something spooky, eerie, or chilling, and I wanted to see it sooner than later. The movie didn\\'t have me gripping my seat much if at all. There was an obvious supernatural being as the villain, but it seemed so limited and a bit benign even. Sure, some horses went missing, but what\\'re a few horses?Then there was the side story with Ricky \\'Jupe\\' Park (Steven Yuen). It had so little to do with the main story that it could be considered a red herring. It was something that could\\'ve been interesting on its own merit, but we weren\\'t here to see that.It kinda picked up towards the end, but again, it didn\\'t deliver on the suspense and chills that I\\'d become accustomed to from Jordan Peele.

Maybe they should sell if to neighbouring theme park dude ranch and ex-child TV star Jupe. More likely they should find someone to film the strange goings on involving power outages and a cloud which has not changed position in weeks.OK, so we have a mystery with scifi/horror overtones from Jordan Peele, very much in the wheelhouse with previous offerings. And it builds quite nicely with a brooding sense of unease and some terrific photography - broad atmospheric landscapes, very effective nighttime sequences, and some imaginative effects work. Not to mention some stirring music and clevervsound design.But I felt with his last film that Peele is in danger of becoming one of those filmmakers whose over-vocal fanbase might lead him to having too much faith in himself, and in need of a critical voice to reain in her self-indulgent excess (see also Shyamalan, Tarantino, Snyder,nAronovsky etc). And the jury is still out her, because Nope has flaws.They say make the most of your pauses. But Daniel Kaluuya doesn't so much pause as wait, both in dialogue and action. Large chunks of dialogue were delivered in incomprehensible slurred dialect. The opening section of Jupe's traumatic child star incident, repeated at length later on, seemed to have nothing to do with anything and could (and should) have been cut without affecting the narrative at all. And I know OJ said Nope, but, as a title, it was underwhelming.But Peele nailed the landing this time.\"},\n",

Jordan Peele, writer/director/actor/producer extraordinaire, has once again confidently demonstrated he has his finger firmly on the pulse of what film fans enjoy. Like his earlier endeavors, \"Get Out\"(2017) and \"Us\" (2019), Peele\\'s remarkable gifts are in his ability to cleverly merge the familiar themes of Western, Horror, Science Fiction, Drama and Comedy, into a seamless, shamelessly artistic yet immensely entertaining film. When people go to the movies, above all, they expect to be entertained. Some filmmakers create movies that have \"pockets\" of entertainment. Peele\\'s films are like a Beatle\\'s album, where every song is great and there\\'s very little \"filler.\" Nope is no exception, and there are no wasted scenes in this hugely entertaining and engaging film!For me, Nope feels like a Wes Craven, John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg collaborative production. And if you\\'re looking for a rather unconventional extraterrestrial threat to we hapless, hopeless Earthlings, you are in for a unforgettable treat. The vibe is very much how \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" would have looked if it had been directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Visually, every scene counts, and there is a unique connection to everything you see and hear, from the opening credits and up to the intense finale. Nope\\'s\\nplot develops on pace with the character development. Indeed, the two are meticulously intertwined.An enormous plus to Nope is the sparkling cast, with sterling performances by Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Brandon Perea, Michael Wincott and Steven Yeun. These are \"actor\\'s actors,\" and for good reason. You\\'ll remember them long after the film\\'s credits stop rolling.No spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that the brief clip of a black jockey riding a horse was actually the first example of a motion picture.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': '\\'Nope\\' is the film equivalent of an unrelenting page-turner. Somehow, Jordan Peele allows you to understand what\\'s happening at the moment as well as the characters\\' intentions without letting you in on his next secret. An attentive viewer will always be up to speed but never ahead of Peele. His proactive writing puts the audience exactly where he wants them to be for the rollercoaster he has built. \\'Nope\\' is a bone-chilling, riveting, and layered film. It is a genre-bending epic on the grandest of scales. In a way, Peele created a spectacle to condemn obsessions with spectacles and prove the horrors that are attached by design. This film manages to masterfully blend Spielbergian sci-fi with Peele\\'s own flavor of psychological horror, creating a once-in-a-lifetime display. All aspects of this film (script, acting, cinematography, sound design, and theme) come together to create possibly my favorite film of the last five years, and, as far as I\\'m concerned, another masterpiece has been added to Jordan Peele\\'s filmography.On the surface, \\'Nope\\' is just a particularly unique and compelling story. It involves two siblings reuniting at their family-owned ranch after their father passes from a freak accident. The siblings are OJ (Kaluuya), that is responsible and hard-working, and his charismatic, creative little sister, Emerald (Palmer). Jordan Peele\\'s script is just remarkable, as are his other two. This film, unlike \\'Get Out,\\' is neither scary nor insidious. It is horror in the same way that \\'Jaws\\' is. \\'Nope\\' is unsettling and unnerving but also incredibly thought-provoking. The story flows so well, that I couldn\\'t divide it into acts based on the plot. I could only divide this story up into three acts based on how much of the UFO is being revealed. For example, in the first third, Peele shows very little, allowing for the viewers\\' minds to run wild (which he has cited as the most frightening thing that can be done to an audience). Though, in the third act, the viewers are permitted to feast their eyes on the spectacle in the sky. I have seen others complain about the movie being broken up into parts based on the horse that is being used, and many of them agreed that it would be better without that. Personally, I do not think it weakened the story, because it\\'s very interesting for the audience to have a focal point on the prey at hand, similar to the UFO and possible predators. Jordan Peele wrote a film that nails all the sci-fi beats and fleshed out a complex family dynamic while holding a tangible tension for the entire two-hour runtime. The world-building was happening parallel to the story unfolding as if he was building the plane while flying it, but only in the best ways.The main cast of this film was comprised of Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya as siblings who were accompanied by Brandon Perea and Micheal Wincott. Palmer is the stand-out that seemingly everyone has been praising for her performance, and it\\'s for good reason. Keke Palmer is absolutely electric as Emerald Haywood. She is the epitome of a bright personality. Palmer exudes charisma and confidence through the screen, while still proving that she can bring the dramatic chops when the moments arise. She was truly oscar-worthy in the role, but I\\'m afraid she overshadowed the more complex character work of Daniel Kaluuya. He was overlooked due to the calm, muted nature of his character, but OJ was intended to be exactly that. Kaluuya is nothing short of spectacular in this film as he embodies the spirit of a responsible and hamstrung older brother. Daniel Kaluuya is a phenomenal physical actor and often his eyes tell the whole story without any lines. I believe there are 2023 Oscar nominations forthcoming for both halves of this on-screen sibling duo. Brandon Perea is solid as the pining and lackadaisical IT guy. He was not a standout by any means, but he held his own enough to make a name for himself and was a good addition to the film. Similarly, I appreciate the addition of Michael Wincott because it brings more symbolism to the table. He plays a very important role and makes some questionable character decisions throughout. Wincott was more than serviceable and played the supporting role in exactly the manner he was supposed to.Hoyte Van Hoytema serves as the cinematographer for this film and deserves all the credit in the world for how gorgeous it looks. The blocking of the characters and framing of the landscape are masterful in this movie. Though, the prize fighter here is the nighttime photography which is just astounding and, frankly, unprecedented. I have never seen night look so beautiful and clear in a film before. Peele described it in an interview as \"...being outside at night and your eyes have adjusted,\" and there is no description more perfect than this one. Van Hoytema mixes stable shots from the porch, epic shots of the sky (day and night), and ride along one-takes that are side-by-side to a motorcycle getaway in this masterclass of cinematography. Also, the sound design in this film is otherworldly. No matter where the scene is physically, it sounds as if you are directly in the middle. The immaculate surround sound quality completely immerses you in the world of \\'Nope.\\' I would not be surprised if this film won Best Cinematography in 2023, but it should be a definite shoo-in for Best Sound Design.I would be remiss if I did not heavily touch on the themes. This is one of the most thematically rich films I have ever seen. I heard another reviewer say something to the effect of \"One can enjoy this film without diving deeper or connecting with the themes,\" which I disagree with. To me, themes, symbolism, and deeper meanings are the structural integrity of this masterpiece. Nearly everything in this film could represent one or more different things and to box them into one interpretation would be asinine. \\'Nope\\' could be dissected from numerous angles. It can be viewed as a deconstruction of Hollywood and what it has become. Secondly, it could be commentary on how a spectacle is just a large-scale flash in the pan. When the moment is gone, so is the hype and focus, therefore, it is finite. When the consensus isn\\'t to look the beast in the eyes, it cannot sustain itself. Thirdly, this could be viewed as the different pitfalls that come from the destructiveness of spectacles i.e. Jupe succumbing to greed, the siblings (initially) shooting for fame, or the cinematographer absurdly pushing his limits. Peele displays that creating idols by misplacing our devotions brings out the worst in humanity. Lastly, it could be viewed as each character representing the parts of a film crew that make up the whole. In this scenario, the struggle over the UFO would reflect those behind the scene wrestling with the idea of trying to capture everything in a film. Getting perfect takes, shots, and even entire films can be nearly impossible because it is a subjective medium. Crews have power struggles with their films, because they want to create the best product without it consuming them. Art is not meant to be nailed down to a science, just like \"some animals aren\\'t meant to be tamed.\"The standing shoe seems to be a highly debated topic of discussion. The shoe to me is more direct than most have made it seem. It is possible that Jupe is misremembering the event because it was very traumatic. Though, I believe it was more - an amazing symbol that Peele adds through Jupe\\'s backstory. Firstly, the shoe that is seemingly standing on its own is what the movie refers to as a \"bad miracle.\" This appears to be an omen that comes to Jupe during a traumatic event, allowing him to focus elsewhere and keep his eyes off of the spectacle. This bad miracle is what preserves Jupe\\'s life. It also is, arguably, what lures him into a false sense of security. He attempts to keep the massacre\\'s memory alive and profit off of it as if he is invulnerable to the repercussions. Secondly, the standing shoe represents the idiom \"waiting for the second shoe to drop,\" which means waiting on an inevitable event. In this case, the inevitable event could be Jupe\\'s eventual death to a spectacle after he becomes greedy for the second time. The event could also just refer to the arrival of another spectacle because it is presumably inevitable that they will keep coming as society keeps promoting them.From Peele\\'s view, I think he wrote this story with a completely different connotation than any viewer could ever resonate with. He seems to be citing this story as how he came racing down into film royalty with a historic script, and that all unfolded so quickly for him. From funny impressionist to an auteur writer-director, his impact on media changed on a dime. \\'Nope\\' seems to be Peele admitting that the duality of becoming an \"event filmmaker\" can be a struggle. Maybe he loves making films but the lifetime contract of fame he had to sign to do it. This makes us, the audience, his biggest problem as he now must create art and please the masses simultaneously.Peele comments on how putting on a show, going viral, being celebrated, and becoming famous are the focuses of modern society - which tear it down from the inside. Whether it\\'s a faceless TMZ reporter going all-in for one photo (that will benefit a corporation more than him) or a cinematographer risking it all for the art of the \"impossible shot,\" many lose everything chasing a spectacle that\\'s out of reach. People nowadays waste their entire waking life trying to be remembered in death. Settings your sights on fame, money, or any hollow spectacle is certain death for the soul. It is completely impossible to reach true happiness this way, so it becomes a neverending cycle that one never awakens from. Rather, there is fulfilling work to be done by following a hopeful dream, creating, and loving along the way. Sometimes, it is necessary to say \"Nope\" to the world and \"Yes\" to something bigger.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"The movie were pretty interesting but what i find too much its the sci fi genre and found it too much present in my opinion. Except that, the movie end pretty brutally and we dont really realise what happened that it end suddenly and it lack of proper ending that make the developpment an honour if i can say that. The movie also have nice developpment of some character's stories ( the character of Steven Yeun, the story of Daniel Kaluuya even if i found too much simple for him.) Like i said there is too much sci fi for me even if it give some interesting shots ( the blood on the house by the monster in the night, the shots inside the monster when he eats people, the festival.) It was nice anwyay and we can learn a lot more about the story of the first black man who ride the horse and that was good to know in the history i mean. The way they kill the monster was too much simple for me ( a balloon seriously?) Steven yeun and his story was quite interesting, his past let us understand how to deal with the monster and to understand him. A nice movie with some nice shots. It have some funny moments less than get out but they are still there to calm things. The characters are not really deep and we are pretty focused on that big monster and that lack it but it was not clearly the purpose so it dont really matter. The movie were pretty simple and that s not quite often with Jordan Peele and it have some subtle hints about things later but the movie dont really need a second time to watch to understand more about the plot or the characters. Thats not really that deep in my opinion but you can still go watch it for the pleasure of course. A little bit disappointed about the complexity of the movie but its still pretty pleasant to watch. For me its a Nope.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Science Fiction/Horror, difficult to say much about the horror aspects without giving away major plot points, sames goes for the peculiar type of UFO/UAP involved. But there's plenty of quirky characters including Ricky (Keith Yeun), he runs a Western Theme Park, he was a child actor in Kid Sheriff and Gordy's Home; in the last episode of Gory's Home a chimp playing Gordy went berserk, killing or maiming all the cast members apart from Ricky. In a ranch next to Ricky's, horse trainer for Hollywood, Otis (Keith David) is killed by a nickel falling from the sky, his horse is injured by key. Otis's children OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald (Keke Palmer) inherit the ranch, the restrained OJ trying to keep things going, Emerald being a bit narcissistic and flamboyant. But the strange events continue, power cuts occur as OJ spots a UFO, the siblings decide to install more cameras hoping to make money from UFO footage. They bring onboard Angel to install the surveillance system and he turns out to be equally offbeat. Thus begins the hunt. There are a few jump scares but and some quite gruesome and disturbing scenes but the film largely depends on building a sense of weirdness as the narrative unfolds. There is a streak of dark humour which runs throughout the film, a lot of it supplied by the antics of Emerald. OJ and Angel, gallows humor indeed at times. It's a bit of a road movie confined to a ranch and the road crew grows as they are joined by Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott), a famed filmmaker. Some great cinematography, script and effects. Written, directed, and co-produced by Jordan Peele who delivers the goods once again, my one caveat being that the 130 minute running time would have benefited from a 10 minute cut. 8.5/10.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Jordan Peele is a director I have a lot of respect for in terms of what he has done for the horror community. Both of his directorial efforts have ranged from really good to brilliant. However with this film, I feel as though his image of the film was an idea that bit off more than he can chew. Although the visuals of the film were brilliant and immersive for the audience, the story that accompanied it was tossed to the side in favor of metaphors of social themes. The abundance of the incorporation of themes made the film feel bloated and confusing when it reaches its conclusion. There are genuinely frightening moments in this film that are a perfect demonstration of visual subtlety. However, much of these scares lack a connective through line that make the film feel cohesive. There are interesting elements of the film that are introduced, but ultimately lacking any meaning towards the end. Although the characters are enjoyable and charismatic, the script never allows them to give the actors a chance to demonstrate their main attributes as actors when compared to other Peele projects. When the film eventually ends, I was left with a feeling of emptiness, knowing that a director as good as Jordan Peele has somewhat fell into the category of pretentiousness. Despite demonstrating brilliant aspects of a horror and visual director in this film, the end product is a clash of themes that have no connection in the long run and barely cohesive story that ultimately leave a mixed and confused feeling towards the audience.'},\n",

I didn't understand how could it be that bad and yet have a pretty high rating here.Then I watched it and it wasn't boring in my opinion, at least not at first.For me, the first half of the movie was way more fun than the second one. I mean characters were crappy for the most part and if it wasn't for Em, there would be zero likable characters in the movie\\nOJ wasn't bad but still hard to love.And it was kind of more exciting while it was still mysterious.It was doing fairly ok until the alien actually showed up and started his bloody hunt.For example, the scene where it devoured the entire audience along with Jupe was a huge fail. We didn't actually see much of anything there. If done well it would show the creature menacingly moving closer while people would try to flee and then it would show them floating in the air as the creature pulls them in. Then it would go for a much more bloody and violent scene than what we got. We saw them all in some kind of a dark hallway or something and no actual bloody deaths at all, yet there was so much screaming that you would have thought we saw anything disturbing. But it failed there.After that the creature was pretty much openly waltzing around and eating basically all but the three main characters.It's just completely lame and stupid compared to what could have been (more people finding out, epic showdown etc).\"},\n",

It literally terrified me and could have been the centre point of an outstanding movie, but instead it was added as if Jordan Peele really didn\\'t know which direction to take the movie in. The two storylines do not successfully meld to make a cohesive story and what\\'s left is a daft sci-fi.

There are some light attempts at development and backstory that just don't lead anywhere.To its credit, I often complain about the entertainment industry not having any unique ideas. Nope has that in spades though. I don't believe I've heard of a plot anything like this one before. I certainly wouldn't turn anyone away from it and perhaps their viewing experience will more enriching than mine.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"A very disjointed movie which seems to want to offer something, but doesn't actually do so. Trying to be sci-fi without being anything really being sci-fi. The story sort of hangs a carrot here and there, but you never really see it. The ending is the same.Story is a little intriguing; horse trainer with a dysfunctional sister, a weird tech-guy and an out-there type of film hunter, all brought together over something no one seems to know or understand.Characters are a little too strange, and maybe more developed for an indie-style movie. The script and even their clothing isn't as polished either.Disappointing if you saw the previews, which were quite well done. More of a social-soapie story with a hint of sci-fi rather than a genuine mystery. The result is a let down, and moreso regarding the object. Good if there is nothing else to watch for 2 hours.\"},\n",

Beyond that, he is trying to prove himself that he is a good writer/director and that he can do something more than that. I never understood why some people while they are talented on one genre they try something else to prove that they are artsy. And this is the story here. We have a BORING, SLOW, story of a horse ranch, where the owner (father) Keith David (a great actor) says only 2 lines in the script as he DIES suddenly after 2 minutes of acting. Why??? You had ONE good actor in this movie and you killed him instantly. The MAIN character (Daniel Kaluuya) is a brain dead character, that pisses me off only by see him acting. I don't know if the script is more boring or his acting. BAD CASTING. Also we have the TERRIBLE amateur VFX (the bullet drops/objects from the sky hitting the ground), the blood spilled on Kaluuya after his dad dies (looks like someone spilled ketchup on him). The blood in the first scene with the monkey (also the blood looks FAKE and like someone spilled it with a nuzzled bottle. The car STILL has the blood after his dad died. His sister is OBNOXIOUS, cannot stand her either. OMG, the selection of the characters. EPIC FAIL. Stopped watching at 30 minutes!!\"},\n",

The writing is really good, as it makes you think on its themes, it has original subject material about exploitation in media, both in the sense of exploiting trauma and animals. All of this in an original way. Actually well constructed suspense, some people may find it silly but It depends on the person, to me when I really thought about it, it was very suspenseful. How the themes are paralleled and seen in Jupe with Gordy in a believable way is just awesome and I love that. The motivations from the characters are also great, OJ dealing with his grief by trying to figure out what happened to his father, whilst also trying to put the Haywood name back in the history books. The symbolism in this movie is also interesting. In conclusion I truly think most if not all of these bad reviews are from people who did not fully, or at all understand this film.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Nope is a new Jordan Peele film. It follows his other two films Get Out and US. After watching Nope I think one thing is certain, Jordan is an incredibly creative director that loves to take risks. Unfortunately in Nope these risks don't pay off as well Get Out and Us.The visuals, great acting, very creative and a great job at creating an eerie, creepy theme are all huge positives. However this film is filled with some major plot armor, side plots that don't go anywhere and the message that one major side plot has is great but is so drawn out. The ending will be either loved or hated (for me I was disappointed). While the overlying message here is backed up by the major side plot, it still feels like it broke its own rules with the ending.Speaking of endings, this ends out of no where. No pay off, no questions answered and no real resolution to the main plot. It's left up for interpretation and assumption and that may be something most don't likeOverall I think Nope is great movie for Jordan Peele in terms of this being his worst film, because this film is good. I think depending on how you like the twist and ending you may find this film much better than I or others did and if this is his worst film, he has a great lineup. There's lots to like in this film, I just wouldn't urge a friend to go see this.\"},\n",

Get Out is in my opinion of the best horror films ever made which is why I was so excited to see this new Jordan Peele film.Jordan Peeles ability to create such an immersive and intense experience is phenomenal. The film keeps you locked in the entire time and has somewhat of a slow burn feel to it. This isn\\'t a horror movie which is not at all a bad thing, this film is much more of a sci-fi thriller and it hits the the majority of its marks.The visuals in this film are outstanding as we see a number of different camera techniques that all blend together to make one of the best cinema experiences of the past decade.The acting is top notch across the board but Keke Palmer is the standout. Daniel Kaluuyas is incredible as well but his character is far more reserved than Kekes character which is why she is able to shine. Brandon Parea is an actor I\\'ve never seen before but he did a great job in his role as well.I really only have one issue with the film and it involves a certain side plot that serves no purpose. They set it up at the beginning and revisited it here and there but by the end of the film I realized that it didn\\'t really amount to anything relevant.Overall \"Nope\" puts Jordan Peeles film making on full display by giving us one of the most mesmerizing films in recent history.9/10\\nA.'},\n",

With the almost cthulhu setup, Nope narrates the blindful pursuit of men behind a rather primal and simple spectacle, a \"bad miracle\" incomprehensible to what most rationalizes or covets. Specifically, Steven Yeun\\'s character fully demonstrates how preconceived obsession could lead to self-destruction, although the section was mainly irrelevant to the major plot. After an hour of allegorical buildout, the movie concludes in a quite cliche and even below-expectation final battle: unexplained sibling collaboration, illogical character motivations, and arguably offbeat ending. Throughout the film, I see lots of dangling threads, including implicit racism, animal references, and directory philosophy, but none of them are elaborated clearly.

Most of these reviews look fake so who knows. I will tell you this though, if you want to waste your money and your 2 hours of time go see this movie. If you don\\'t want to waste your money and time, just say Nope! I give it one star for effects, and another for cinematography, as well as a third star for acton scenes that were the only saving grace in this movie.Let\\'s start out with the fact that there\\'s absolutely no character building. You\\'re jumped right in and expected to understand exactly what is going on and to be honest with you even by the end of the movie you never quite figured it out. To avoid spoilers I will not give exact details, but, the only reason this is listed as a horror movie is because of several flashbacks to an incident that happened 30 years prior that were bloody and gory. The movie itself has no blood no gore and the flashbacks mean absolutely nothing to the overall tempo or plot to the movie.You never quite understand what is actually happening because nobody really explains it. The overall plot of the movie is so singular and uninspired that it will shock you once you figure out what it actually is. It was absolutely pointless and if these were real people would be nothing with the results of weak minds.I understand from a certain situation Jordan Peele likes to insert race into his movies and have the movies be a big part of the overall race discussion in this country. That\\'s fine, that\\'s his style and he\\'s more than welcome to it. I will say though, that the way race was inserted into this movie does nothing to spark a conversation. In fact based on actual history that this movie refers to it appears to be given quite liberal license here.There\\'s only one character I truly got to enjoy in the movie and it wasn\\'t either of the two primary characters. Again without giving away spoilers I don\\'t want to say anything but, the main character spoke in three to five word sentences throughout the movie. His co-star was a woman completely out of touch with reality and honestly made very little sense throughout the movie herself. Her comments and statements that were made simply didn\\'t fit for what was going on. I saw this movie in a full theater and heard a few chuckles where they were obviously meant to happen but overall this theater was silence and I heard a lot of mumbling during the movie at the absolute \"ugh\" points in the movie.If you want to see this movie wait until it comes out on streaming video where you can watch it for free on one of your streaming services. Don\\'t waste your time or money going to the theater to see it and if you think you absolutely must see it in the theater see it during a matinee because I assure you it\\'s not worth $17 to $20 and it\\'s definitely not worth $25 to see it in iMAX.Save your money...pick something else.'},\n",

Make no sense whatsoever and is probably the worst film I've seen so far in 2022 and I've seen some turkeys. How this film has scored 7 on here is mind boggling just like the film itself. This film is no Close Encounters of the Third Kind trust me! Where are all the decent directors these days because all we get is churned out garbage. I've seen all three of Peele's films he has directed and this is by far the worst. I do find him a very overrated director. His films play out a bit like a M. Night Shyamalan project but just the end product is never as good.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Suspenseful and fantastic thriller with unexpected and overwhelming denouement. The opening credits are shown along with a green square, later zooming in to the first motion picture of a black man riding a horse . Otis Haywood Sr (Keith David) and his son, Otis Jr (Daniel Kaluuya) referred to as OJ , begin their day by taking care of the horses at their Hollywood ranch, Haywood\\'s Hollywood Horses. In the background, a radio mentions the mysterious disappearance of two hikers. After random objects falling from the sky result in the death of their father. Ranch-owning siblings OJ and Emerald Haywood (Keke Palmer) attempt to capture video evidence of an unidentified flying object that suddenly makes grotesque appearances . Otis thinks he has a close encounter of the third kind and utter horror turns into morbid curiosity , while starting unraveling cryptic and increasingly horrifying happenings . And he asks for the help of tech salesman Angel Torres (Brandon Perea) and documentarian Antlers Holst (Michael Wincott) and in order to get money enough . The team turns to different means to handle the extraterrestrial invasion . From Jordan Peele, writer/director of \\'Get Out,\\' comes a New Nightmare. Watch Yourself. Years Ago, Jordan Peele Redefined the Genre with \"Get Out\" and ¨Us¨. On March 22, Discover His New Nightmare !.Awesome but overlong fantasy/thriller/terror picture in which filmmaker Jordan Peele takes a Hollywood Horses horse-handling business and a few fine actors conjuring up some moving , horrifying and nail-biting scenes . This is a weird film that had one of the highest live action non-franchise openings of all time . Concerning the residents of a lonely gulch in inland California bear witness to an uncanny and chilling discovery . They each start having disturbing , strange experiences linked to dark and bizarre events that have been ultimately shocked . A thrilling and terrifying fiction about two brothers who are haunted by an unfortunate extraterrestrial invasion and then happens a lot of horrifying occurrences, including suspense , intrigue , turns , a lot of twisted incidents , at the same time charged with disturbing tension , unflinching depictions of creepy attacks and high level staging which the viewer could really enjoy . A great success film about two siblings join a team who\\'s linked to sinister and spectacular happenings with plenty of shocks , being compellingly directed with well staged set pieces and plenty of startling visual content and imagination enough . Above average supernatural movie in which the bizarre , otherworldly events are developing themselves little by little , at the beginning alarming hints of an eerie appearances begin to emerge, enfolding the siblings in a shroud of suspicion and mental agony until a surprising conclusion . The story is well paced , suffering from some strange incidents of varying quality , packing nice as well as scary moments . There are some really creepy scenes with extreme terror , breathtaking pursuits , ghastly surprises and outstanding the pleasantly visual look too with state-of-art digital special effects. The picture is really influenced by classic films as King Kong (1933), Jurassic Park (1993), Close encounters of the third kind (1977), Signs (2002), and The Wizard of Oz (1939) . This Nop ! Results to be a seamless mix of fantasy , Sci-fi , eerie terror and a few doses of dark humor . Interpretations are uniformly good . Here stands out Daniel Kaluuya as the young entrepreneur taking care of the horses at their Hollywood ranch until he finds a surprising appearance , and Keke Palmer as the distraught and brave sister , both of whom will stop at nothing to defend their house . Along with the fine remaining cast giving top-notch interpretations , such as Steven Yeun as a former child actor who owns a Western-themed amusement park , Brandon Perea as Angel Torres , Michael Wincott as Antlers Holst , Keith David as Otis Haywood Sr and veteran Donna Mills as Bonnie Clayton .Special mention for the really hypnotic and thrilling musical score by composer Michael Abels . Likewise , adequate and colorful cinematography by cameraman Hoyte Van Hoytema. This suspenseful and fantasy motion picture was competently written/produced/directed by Jordan Peele who often uses long uninterrupted camera shots . Jordan has only directed three successful films : Get out (2017), Us (2019) and Nop ! (2021) . Peele considers some vintage films as examples of addiction to spectacle, a major theme in the picture. Jordan is a prestigious director and writer with penchant for terror movies . He is known for co-writing and starring in the comedy Keanu (2016), opposite his close friend Keegan-Michael Key, for writing and directing the horror film Get Out (2017), which was nominated for Best Picture, lead Actor : Daniel Kaluuya , winning the Screenplay award , and Director at the Academy Awards, and for writing-directing-plus duties on Us (2019) . Rating : 6.5/10 . Acceptable and passable fantasy movie , but tiring at times and overlong . The flick will appeal to supernatural flicks fans .'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I have no idea why this film is labeled as a horror movie. It has zero tension. The word I would use to describe it is \"dull\". Clocking in at 130 minutes it is at least a half hour too long. Not much happens with either character or story. After a while I was just waiting for it to end to be honest. The only scene which even comes close to offering a little bit of tension is the one with the aliens in the barn, and that quickly turned out to be just a fake out.I have no idea who the girl playing the sister is, but I\\'m guessing she\\'s not a professional actor. She is so bad in this film it becomes a distraction. Kaluya sleepwalks through the entire film.I have more to say about the racist nature of Peele\\'s films, but IMDb declines those reviews due to some incomprehensible guidelines, even though those same guidelines clearly state: \"The best reviews include not only whether you liked or disliked a movie or TV-series, but also why.\"I guess that\\'s one way for IMDb to up the scores.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Okay, so at first I was thinking what is this movie trying to say and what is the plot?Well, basically the UFO is territorial and uses the ranch as it's hunting ground, anyone who looks at it gets eaten or killed.It perfectly mirrors the start of the film with the monkey killing the cast members in 1998, the balloon popped and made the monkey mad and territorial, which made it kill people. The UFO is the same, it's being territorial.At the end when they finally kill it, they use a big cowboy balloon, which mirrors the start with the monkey.Anyway, the UFO made itself look pretty and wanting you to come closer to it so it can eat you, this is similar to most sea creatures baiting prey.The horse wasn't killed because he doesn't look up at it, he isn't frightened and stays calm.This film, in order to understand it you would need to think outside the box, it's a good film but not the greatest. It's bizarre and good.Unfortunately I don't think I would watch it again as I can play it in my head, which is a good thing because that means it made me pay attention to what was going on.It's a good story, really crisp film quality and no annoying actors or music, I enjoyed it.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I was able to be present at the first avant-premiere showing here in Belgium for 'Nope' (2022) which is directed by the one and only Jordan Peele. The movie features stars like Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer and Steven Yeun. This is my personal, detailed rating of the movie based on multiple key aspects that I believe define what makes a movie good or bad. I watched the movie in cinemas (IMAX) with my brother and we found it terrifyingly amazing; almost on par with Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' which I absolutely loved and recommend.I had watched the first trailer going into this movie and gathered from it that aliens were going to be involved one way or another. In a way I was right, but this movie took it to a whole different level. The idea of an UFO being an actual living creature is creatively refreshing and absolutely petrifying. I loved the story and the concept, along with the great execution.The large open areas at night accompanied by no dialogue, no music, nothing- gave me this chilling tense vibe; not allowing my eyes to even blink because I was glued to the screen, waiting for something to appear. And it did sometimes, extremely vaguely. Just long enough for us to notice it, but short enough for us to not understand what we just saw.The characters are intelligent and I love it. It's such a cliché having dumb characters doing idiotic things in horror films just to further the plot in a gory or scary direction. I love that this movie didn't have to do that. It was scary enough already. From the mysterious purple people eater in the sky to the people actually being eaten alive without the scene cutting away- which one would suspect.The little amount of jump scares got me every time as well. Such weren't prevalent in this movie since tense atmosphere and chilling mystery is what made this movie super intense. As always, the subtle comedy was perfectly fit and gave me as a viewer a slight stress relief every now and then which was well needed most of the time. I also believe this movie has hidden meanings and 'lessons', which I could deepdive into but I won't. Let's just say that I appreciate them very much and that they're well placed- as in not forced.Soundtrack and sound design (especially for the 'alien') were pristine. The cinematography and lighting was awesome as well. Night scenes in this film look incredible and the massive scale of the 'desert' reflect itself effortlessly thanks to the use of IMAX cameras. Speaking of scale, the filmmakers managed really well to make the main 'house' and characters feel so small on their grande property and surroundings. It makes them feel extremely trapped even though they're in this free open zone of nothingness.Acting was on point- as always with these great actors. I'm a big fan of Daniel Kaluuya so I might be slightly biased there, but I was very presently surprised by Keke Palmer's performance since I hadn't seen her in any other movies before. All the other characters in the movie carried their parts perfectly as well next to these two leads. Not a single miss from the casting director.I personally rate this movie a 8.5/10, losing some points because the story segments sometimes felt disjointed and I would have loved to see Jupe's story arch (involving Gordy's Massacre) play a bigger part in the overall story. It felt like a small, separate character study- which I liked, but I wish it was 'more' than that. But maybe I misunderstood. Anyway, the movie was great and I can't wait to see more from Peele in the future.\"},\n",

It\\'s tonally all over the place, trying for a horror comedy vibe that Peele can\\'t pull off, despite the fact that he did it so well in \"Get Out.\" There are a bunch of strands that don\\'t feel like they ever come together, and the ending is downright stupid. An entire storyline devoted to a chimp who goes berserk during the taping of a beloved sitcom could have been removed from the movie entirely without changing anything -- and would pretty much have eliminated Stephen Yeun\\'s reason for being in the movie at all -- though ironically those scenes are the most horrifying in the movie and the ones that got into my head the most.A big misfire, but I\\'m willing to stick with Peele and see what he does next.Grade: C.'},\n",

A huge niche was taken by a superheroine, and quality tapes in other directions have not been observed for a long time.And here comes Nope. And what did we get?And we got a very original and cool story with a cool plot and an atmosphere of constant tension.Yes, the unhurried beginning is characteristic of Pill's films. And the main thing is to survive the first 25-30 minutes. Further, the story will capture the viewer in its tentacles, heats up interest with mysterious events and does not let go.The novelty does not lie in the shooting method or the revolutionary picture (although it is at a decent level). We are talking about an antagonist about a rival of the main characters. And it is precisely in this that this film has every chance to restart the genre and give screenwriters new ideas based on what they have seen.Pill turned out a fairly solid fantasy with anxiety, tension and working elements of horror.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Just visited the premiere here in Antwerp, Belgium. To be honest, I was looking forward to this film once I heard about it a year ago. Needless to say, my expectations were quite high, given Peele's reputation, the budget for this movie, the marketing around it and the interview Peele recently gave in Universal Studios. He recommended to go and see the movie in Imax, so that's what I did. I was really excited to see this movie, as you can obviously tell.However...This movie turned out quite different than what I was expecting. It definitely had my attention from the start. I appreciated almost every aspect of the movie, but at some point things tool a turn for the worse. Hoping this would all resolve itself as the movie was progressing, I was being disappointed again and again. Now, I have to say, I gave it a lot of margin for error, 'cause I truly wanted to like this movie.There seemed to be times where the story unfolded but doesn't pick up on that storyline, causing me as a viewer to get distracted. This lead me to believe it was just my wrong understanding of things or me not focussing hard enough on the details or in general. In short, it felt a mess and I couldn't quite decide what was causing it.If I had to point at something, I would say Nope tries to please too many people at the same time. Instead of providing some authentic and refreshing horror, it falls into this category of horror that is not particularly original and easily forgotten. Maybe this 'evolution' is unavoidable when directors start to reach a wider audience and have to work with bigger budgets, but it feels like Jordan Peele should try to return to the basics and work with less instead of more. That would essentially force him creatively to make things work on a different level, as opposed to throwing money in expensive CGI. In the end, it's all about a compelling story and no amount of effects or brilliant shots are going to make up for that, at least in my opinion.So yeah, there you have it. I hate that I didn't love this film, 'cause I consider myself a Jordan Peele fan, but this movie just wasn't for me, unfortunately.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulAfter the death of their father, OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) inherit the family ranch, and are left to take care of it. All is fine, until suddenly strange, unexplainable phenomena start taking place in the skies above, leading to a series of shocking events. The siblings seek the help of Antlers Hoist (Michael Wincott), an expert in the paranormal, to deal with the situation, whilst local theme park owner Ricky Park (Steven Yuen) tries to profit from it.Certain films can arrive with a tonne of hype, and pass you by upon their release. Nope, reuniting actor Daniel Kaluuya with writer/director Jordan Peele, after their 2017 classic Get Out, seemed like one such film, gaining some pretty good reviews and doing fairly well at the box office. I certainly felt left out not catching it first time round, but hey ho. And so, upon finally passing my eyes, I'm left perplexed and overwhelmed, pummelled by a film too carried away with itself to get the right effect.Peele, it would seem, is focused on making a film told in reverse plotting, depicting some events from early on in the central characters lives, that seemingly come to have some bearing on the present events in the film, but they're left unresolved, without a satisfactory explanation to how they tie in with the events we see in the film, and all we're left with is a rather uninvolving affair, indulgently spaced out at around two hours. Kaluuya retains the presence he displayed in GO, and has some strong chemistry with co star Palmer, but their performances are not strong enough to save this overblown, over hyped mess.I sense a love-it/hate-it situation coming on with this film, and I can appreciate there may be those who can see things in it that maybe I can't, but I'm in the camp of its over my head. And I loved Get Out. **\"},\n",

Daniel Kaluuya and Steven Yeun are also enjoyable, as are Michael Wincott and Brandon Perea to be fair - albeit less so. Neat to see Keith David involved too, I need to see him in a more prominant role at some point - only ever seems to be a bit-part in what I've seen of him thus far.\"},\n",

But, the film really takes awhile to build towards that. I can see how there can be an overall theme about nature and to respect it. At the end of the day, animals are wild and will act on instinct. But, the theme often feels muddled throughout the movie. Like for instance with Jupe and his show. I can get how it fits into the theme...but from a story standpoint...if he knew about the alien and was using it in his show for months.....then how did the world not know about this yet?I found myself really enjoying the movie towards the third act. I also think the actors did a good job. It was visually stunning. There was just also a lot of parts where I felt really bored. And not all of the elements felt super clear.\"},\n",

I wasn\\'t blown away by it, but it was definitely a good movie. \\'US\\' was just stupid. And his miniseries \\'Them\\', started out well, but then just got weird in a very bad way. And there is nothing wrong with \"weird\", but there is good weird, and bad weird. Peele has trended too far into \"bad weird\" territory, far too often.\\'NOPE\\' is just bad all around from start to finish. It leaves you wondering what Peele was thinking when he served us this turd. It was even bad for his standards. There were a few things that stuck out like a turd in punchbowl, when it came to this movie:1. The entire \\'crazy chimp\\' side story was completely unnecessary and pointless. These scenes alone added about 20 minutes of useless footage to the movie.2. The pacing was so slow, that you lost interest FAR too often. Any interest that was drummed up, was quickly squashed by nothing happening.3. The Alien/Animal, was just silly and goofy. I mean this thing is just some huge floating vacuum monster. How lame was that? And in the end, it transforms into some balloon animal? Come on now.4. The characters were either far too dry, or far too over the top. The main character acts like he just hit some good stuff and is in chill mode, and his sister acts like she\\'s on a sugar rush the entire movie.5. There was no plot. This thing just gets hungry, vacuums everything up, then takes a dump on everybody. And everything . That really sums it up. No information of where it comes from, why it\\'s here...nothing.I won\\'t go on too much longer, but this movie is flat out bad. And it\\'s by FAR Peele\\'s weakest to date. And that\\'s saying a lot with his work after \\'Get Out\\'.'},\n",

I Love anything with a UFO and saucers especially..The opening of the show is Slow,ponderous and almost boring with sidestories that seem like the writers were on an acid trip...Getting past that to the initial scenes in the desert at night when Something mysterious is seen Out There, it starts getting interesting...The craft is both cool and slick to see silently manuvering around the clouds but up close views look bizzare with a strange notch in the front edge of the saucer as if it were thrown together in someones garage and hand built... this is supposed to be Alien...Then theres the dialogue or should I say, the lack of it... the talk was so weird that I had to turn on subtitles to make sure what they were saying and even then, it was often some kind of gibberish that made sense perhaps only to the writers...No sense to me.... Why on earth are you going to name a ufo \"jean jacket?\" Where does thinking like that even come from? Now as far as the good moments, that has to be when the craft is attacking the occupants of the house at night and overshadowing the home..The rain is pouring down, the craft is totally Dark, no lighting ,and its overshadowing the home as well as the dudes truck.. Now Thats seriously cool! Scenes that were a letdown for me were the ending with the craft suddenly turning from a saucer into some kind of flowy kite looking like it was made of fabric, billowing in the sky... I mean What is This? As much as I love UFO movies, this was a strange one and not in a good way...its a watch just for the oddness of it and it Has its moments like when the craft is on full attack but the rest of the time, the story is seriously lacking substance.You decide..'},\n",

Despite all of my criticism the cinematography of the film is good as well as the acting and sound design for the film, also the visuals of when the people are digested by the alien and when the alien rains blood and guts over the house is memorable and unique I think it's just the story itself that's was not adequate enough.\"},\n",

He has a real screen presence and is entirely believable as the son carrying the weight of his father\\'s legacy. Brandon Perea is also excellent in the role of Angel.That\\'s where the good stuff ends. Stephen Yuen is barely in this and the exposition scene that he does take centre stage ultimately makes absolutely no sense.The rest is a series of ridiculous plot holes and themes stitched together in a boring movie that\\'s 45 minutes too long. Events related to the characters are presented to you in flashbacks and then never discussed again. The UFO is somewhere between a Walker from War of the World\\'s and a Ferrari. It also seems to shrink or increase in size randomly depending on what shot was needed.It scales down from a ship that appears to be a mile long while in the clouds to something the size of a school bus.The UFO attacks people who look at it. But not always. And sometimes it doesn\\'t attack at all. And it is hilariously invisible to the dozens of police and agents investigating the disappearances at the farm...even though it\\'s flying around in the sky in the middle of the day.I think Jordan Peele watched Independence Day, a cowboy movie, War of the Worlds and Communion on the same night, drank a lot and then decided \"I can do better\".Nope will hopefully be Jordan Peele\\'s last movie.He\\'s a one hit wonder by every single measurement possible.This is 12-year-old fan fiction quality writing.'},\n",

Runtime too long for nonexistent story, the actors were good but all clearly wished to be somewhere else.Jordan Peele does not understand that you can't make movies in the traditionally 'lightweight' genres such s thriller and sci-fi with a massive message tacked on just for personal gratification. It does not work and is painfully cringe for the people outside the intended audience of whatever sermon he tires to deliver. If Jordan Peele has issues with Hollywood it seems like a bad idea to vent them in a Hollywood movie, to the people who made him what he is.Successful summer blockbusters (Nope is just a wannabe, there will be no reruns for this drivel next year) must be made enjoyable for everyone, or they will fail. This might have been the last attempt Jordan Peele got; there are other, more gifted, less prone to stealing ideas and with less preachy baggage filmmakers waiting in the wings.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Comedian and filmmaker Jordan Peele made a household name for himself after his breakout directorial debut, Get Out, on top of obtaining a solid status in the film & television market. After his second feature Us, his latest venture in the realm of experimental horror is Nope, a modern take on the UFO narrative. Released to generally positive reviews and decent financial returns thus far, the film has gotten a good amount of attention for mixing a timeless commentary on Hollywood\\'s mistreatment of animals and how intergalactic species perceive human beings. So how did this flick fair overall?The main storyline follows siblings Em and Otis Harwood Jr, who attempt to capture evidence of an unidentified flying object that has been consuming horses from their father\\'s ranch. With a premise as simple as that, one would imagine the usual narrative where two lowly people have to prove to everyone that this strange intergalactic being is real. However, the story instead focuses solely on the lead characters trying to make end\\'s meet with what little they have and the UFO being a huge problem secondary. As the children of Otis Harwood Sr. And new owners of Haywood\\'s Hollywood Horses Ranch, the commentary on how poorly Hollywood treats horses is emphasized through OJ\\'s jaded mind of being stuck in a constant loop. It doesn\\'t help that the business is being squashed by former child star Ricky \"Jupe\" Park and his successful desert theme park Jupiter\\'s Claim. Although both of these characters face different circumstances from traumatic life situations, the intergalactic specimen coming in to take stuff from them away leads to consequences too severe to handle at once.On the other side of the coin, Em wants to seek fame and fortune while also having a deep admiration for the big screen, but the sudden shock of whatever this strange creature is leads her to become way more dedicated to putting a stop to it than her brother. Tech salesman Angel Torres is another added bonus by initially going along with the Harwoods far-fetched plans to capture photographic evidence, eventually becoming entranced by the numerous power outages that the UFO causes from hovering over. Since the film avoids any obvious cliches of the ordinary people not immediately believing the Harwoods until it\\'s too late, the characters that set out to destroy the creature remain the most memorable, down to Michael Wincott\\'s stoically awesome performance as the impossible seeking cameraman. If there\\'s anything to criticize story wise, it would be that Jupe\\'s backstory as a child actor doesn\\'t serve the plot as effectively as one would hope. It does tie into the themes of animal exploitation, but let\\'s just say that his downfall wasn\\'t a good first impression to the film\\'s main focus.Going into the filmmaking qualities, the sound design and cinematography are the real stars of the movie from a suspense standpoint. Because no one ever knows when the strange flying object will appear next, the scariest moments in the film come as soon as you can hear the creature coming. On top of these moments happening often at the darkest corners at nighttime, Hoyte van Hoytema plays a lot with shaky camera angles to make the audience feel as tense as the characters desperate to escape this frightening entity. Also, given the film\\'s love letter to film history, the added bonuses of retro film techniques paint certain sequences in an almost homemade format, as if the filmmakers are aware how much their lead characters adore oldschool cinema. Also, while definitely more effective on the big screen than otherwise, Michael Albes\\' score could send chills down even the most thick skinned human being. It\\'s often saved for just the right moments too, allowing the more laid back moments with the Harwoods to contrast better with what\\'s to come inevitably.While definitely not without its obvious outcomes, Nope is a solidly executed horror film that elevates a cliched narrative through timeless themes of spectacle and exploitation not often tackled in cinema. On top of its love letter to filmmaking and a charming cast of characters, the sheer ambition Jordan Peele and crew put into this odd movie shows that we might only be scratching the surface in what the man can deliver. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone interested, whether you\\'re a horror sci-fi fan or into films that tackle the dark side of the entertainment world. After all, Peele has got your back.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Ever since the release of Get Out, many people, including myself, have kept a close eye on whatever director Jordan Peele's next project would be. I loved Get Out and Us, even though some viewers find the ending unsatisfying. When I heard he was working on a third film, I was excited, regardless of the material, and became even more excited when I heard the title would simply be Nope. Well, it has now hit theatres and while I enjoyed it, for the most part, it's definitely the weakest of Peele's films so far, at least to me. Here's why, although it's impressive from a filmmaking standpoint, it didn't quite do it for me overall.After the death of their father, in a valley outside of California, OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) and Emerald (Keke Palmer), a bother and sister are running their ranch, when they begin to see something in the sky. They believe it to be some sort of alien spacecraft, so they purchase cameras to film it. As animal handlers in the film industry, they at least know their way around film equipment. As this story progresses and other characters work their way into the story, it becomes pretty enjoyable throughout the first two acts, but the third act didn't quite work for me.As fans of Jordan Peele's films can expect, everything has a secondary meaning or underlying narrative throughout each of his films. This film had a lot less of that and decided to go for a big reveal/twist, but I didn't think it worked. As the film slowly progresses, you begin to get more and more answers, and I was putting everything together before the big reveal even happened. The mystery was lost on me pretty early on. When the film finally does shine a light on what has been really going on, I more or less just shrugged my shoulders. This was a very interesting premise that felt a little empty to me.Still, with that said, the cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is stellar and the entire cast is giving their all here. On top of that, I will say that the few moments of spectacle are also fun to watch, I just wish they had a bigger impact on me. Jordan Peele also continues to be a fantastic director, I just think exploring a few more things throughout the story would've helped. So to wrap up my thoughts, the social commentary was great, the visuals were stunning, the performances were top-notch, and the overall story kept me engaged, but where the film went just wasn't satisfying to me. I can't quite recommend rushing out to see Nope.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I place great trust in Jordan Peele simply on the basis of prior horror films \\'Get out\\' and \\'Us,\\' both exploring the genre in two very different ways but with an indefatigable finesse and exquisite craftsmanship like few other titles can claim. In pretty much every way imaginable \\'Nope\\' caught my eye from the moment it was first announced. To sit and watch, I think this distinctly falls short of perfect; chiefly, I think this is longer than it needed to be, and a fair bit could have been cut or at least considerably reduced (mostly from the first half) without losing much. Given the subtle yet unmistakable overall themes there\\'s ultimately nothing extraneous to the whole, but surely the runtime could have been reined in a bit. Even at that, however, at its creepy and invigorating best this is incredibly well made and imaginative, breathing new, vivid life into the sci-fi horror genre that\\'s generally overcrowded with overdone and common tropes.The concept of the creature is fantastic in and of itself, ingenious and downright beautiful. Yet it\\'s all those more discreet ways in which its presence becomes known that is the real bread and butter of the picture. The sound effects are haunting, recalling the most perfectly chilling aspect of 2018\\'s \\'Annihilation.\\' The miscellanea that follows in its wake is cheekily inventive in the way it adds to the tableau. All the visual special effects, meanwhile - relatively mundane by the standards of the genre - are altogether seamless, and still further the sharp dread that so readily pervades the feature, and the building excitement. I\\'d be remiss not to also mention Michael Abels\\' outstanding score, lending tremendously to the charged atmosphere at any given point.Usually I\\'d key in more on every little element to greet us. By and large, however, save for the excess and resulting slow pace and significant length, \\'Nope\\' is one big \"Yeah!\" as far as I\\'m concerned. The cast are flawless, as is Peele\\'s direction and Hoyte van Hoytema\\'s cinematography. The production design and art direction are superb, and the costume design, too; every little detail put into this film is wonderfully vibrant, and clever at that. While it\\'s perhaps a tad self-indulgent, I love Peele\\'s screenplay, even as the climax turns extra playful. The characters and dialogue feel refreshingly real, the scene writing is exceptionally smart and mindful, and the narrative at large is a blast - strongly absorbing, and richly satisfying. I speak in broad terms, yes, but what more do you really want here?I\\'m inclined to say that Peele\\'s first directed feature, \\'Get out,\\' remains his best to date, and \\'Nope\\' his most imperfect. This is only by a nose, however, and more to the point, imperfection at the level Peele operates on is still layers and layers above many other filmmakers and movies that are out there. If this is Peele demonstrating self-indulgence, as I believe it to be, he\\'s still far more self-restrained and thoughtful than too many other examples to name. I had high expectations for \\'Nope\\' from the time I first heard about it; to whatever extent they might not have been fully met, it\\'s more true that they weren\\'t met in the way I anticipated. Here, I think that\\'s certainly to the credit of the filmmaker, his cast, and his crew to have presented us with something that approaches the genre from a fresh angle, and with a keen eye, and still to do so in a fashion that differs from what one supposed based on any slight advance knowledge. Suffice to say I\\'m impressed: while those facets discretely surrounding the creature itself are what will stick out for me the most the further away I get from the viewing experience, all the same I believe this is another roundly excellent notch in the belt of a filmmaker who continues to prove the passion, intelligence, and heart he has to give to cinema. Flaws and all, at length \\'Nope\\' is another terrific picture from Jordan Peele, and I can\\'t wait to see what he does next.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Nope, the third film by Jordan Peele, is a thematically-driven mental puzzle under the guise of a science fiction film. It\\'s a thinker that delights in its unconventional approach, taking left turns which will either keep audiences guessing or frustrated at what it\\'s about.After the mysterious death of their father Otis from a falling object in the sky, horse ranch owners Otis Jr. And his sister Emerald witness an UFO one night. In an effort to profit from this, they attempt to photograph the suspected UFO with the help of an video appliance store clerk Angel and filmmaker Antlers Holst.Since his debut with Get Out, it\\'s been fascinating watching Jordan Peele develop as a filmmaker. The work is vastly different than his comedic sketches from Key and Peele. Always coming in with a left field approach, his films are original, unique and always thought provoking.Nope, an acronym for \"Not of Planet Earth\", has the appearance of a Steven Spielberg or a Christopher Nolan blockbuster. However, Jordan Peele\\'s interests are more artistic and veers left from center, preferring to slow burn and set up ciphers rather than delivering action beats every 20 minutes.The cast does a great job enhancing the story despite it not being a performance-centered piece. Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya create a nice sibling dynamic and are an underused comedic duo. Brandon Perea is quite the scene-stealer as Angel the tech store clerk.Taking a cue from Christopher Nolan, Nope is completely shot on IMAX. Hoyte Van Hotema, Nolan\\'s cinematographer, uses the IMAX square to frame in the Californian landscape along with the sky, thus allowing the audience to look up and search the clouds with the characters.The tracking shots trailing behind Daniel Kaluuya riding a horse and Keke Palmer on a motorcycle across a field, building on Hotema\\'s photography from Interstellar, were breathtakingly gorgeous.There was a consistent joy throughout Nope that I was in Peele\\'s solid capable hands and everything was going to be clever and unexpected. To its credit, the film delivers on that. I thoroughly enjoyed piecing together the puzzle pieces of what the film is about, which won\\'t be revealed here.What\\'s ultimately lacking from Nope is resonance. After you\\'ve discussed what everything meant and figured out the film\\'s message, there\\'s nothing to take away from beyond that.The mystique that the film had on my first viewing was gone on my second. Characters do not learn or gain anything or change internally through the ordeal. What the story initially held at stake was left to the wayside and goes unanswered. And the film\\'s message just stands there above these incomplete pieces; all cool and smoking a cigarette with a leather jacket but standing alone nonetheless.Nope is not for everybody. In fact, I had a better time discussing the film than the theatrical experience than itself.Once you\\'ve concluded your thoughts about its message, there\\'s no need to see it again. I\\'m pretty sure Jordan Peele planned for us to be mystified with repeat viewings.

Like Us and Get Out, Nope's opening moments point to the terrible tragedy of a chimpanzee which is let loose on a live TV show. This is essentially what we're dealing with here, the idea that some predators cannot be controlled.OJ and Emerald are siblings and have the responsibility of looking after a ranch which loans out horses to the film industry. Their tagline is that they are the only ranch owned by POC. After their father is killed in mysterious circumstances, both have to take on the workload, but Emerald is very reluctant to do so, leaving the normally reticent OJ to do the hard work.Add in to all of this, a plot about a something airborne which plays havoc with the ranch but leads both of them to try and make their fortune proving aliens exist and you have the recipe for an interesting film with a plot that has a load of nods to film makers like Spielberg and also a massive nod to the Independence Day movie.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'First trailer was incredibly misleading. I was expecting it to be a horrifying or at the very least interesting story but what I got in the end was both poorly executed and frustrating beyond belief.For starters the acting was godawful. Daniel Kaluuya showed barely any emotion. I swear to god during the scene where his dad got killed he only looked zoned out and bored, and for the rest of the movie he had that same facial expression regardless of the situation. Aside from that him and almost every other actor mumbled their lines so I couldn\\'t understand roughly half of what they were saying.The twist made no sense and was both simultaneously bizarre and unsatisfying, especially considering that opening scene implying a narrative about our relationship with creatures of lesser intelligence (seriously the side story with the chimp had no payoff). The UFO being an individual animal simply hunting in what it believed to be its territory not only destroyed the mystery and left no room for any potentially interesting ideas, but made the movie boring and unscary. It also seemed like the idea forced the writers into a corner because at every plot point they compensated by making the characters complete idiots in order to make justification for conflict. Every decision the characters made, especially during the final sequence, had me yelling at the them in my own head. They literally establish that the UFO (for no apparent reason) won\\'t consume a person or animal as long as they don\\'t look into its \"eye,\" and you would think this would resolve the problem and allow the characters to safely record without incident, but instead they do every illogical and insane thing they could possibly do, which is by far the most annoying thing a horror movie can do. Really disappointed to see Jordan Peele go that route and have every character act illogically to force conflict into the story.I appreciate them trying to do something at least different but in the end the execution of their idea was poor and really undermined my excitement for where the story was going to go.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Frankly, I never considered Peele's movies as horror. Perhaps a satirical dark comedy at best, but even the premise of Get Out had my laughing out of my seat at the concept, especially when the director himself pretty much sums up the plot of the movie in such succinct manner. Since then I have to wonder if its just me or are his movies plots are just getting ridiculous. I can't help feeling like this movie was designed to mock the audience's inability to critique anything lest they be cancelled. It sort of remind me of an old folktale called The Emperor's New clothes that speaks about vanity.Nope is a movie about a brother and sister suddenly burdened with their family ranch and all debts incurred along with it, after their father is killed under mysterious circumstances. Unfortunately for them, the ranch valley is also the hunting grounds for a giant alien cowboy hat that hides within the clouds.If its not obvious from the name of the movie, the entire premise feels like something that was formulated by Peele after one too many drinks at a party. The entire movie feels like a social experiment to gauge the general crowds intelligence or lack thereof. Its rather ironic that we continue to make fun of M. Night Shamalayans movies yet somehow try to convince ourselves that this film is clever because its too on the nose with its ridiculous plot.There are movies that work better on the big screen while others are better off with the direct to TV format. Unfortunately neither format really elevates it from the feeling that you are being taken on a ride by robbing of your time and money.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"When compared to Get Out and Us - the earlier two films made by Jordan Peele - Nope definitely feels more mysterious. It's harder to know exactly what's beneath the surface here, but that's one of the things that makes it stand out, and is a further demonstration that Peele is one of the best horror filmmakers out there right now. I don't doubt that everything in this film has a purpose, but it's a film that has many mystery elements in it while you watch it, and then elements of it continue to feel mysterious after it ends.The core premise - about capturing visual proof of UFOs - is always easy to follow and exciting. Nope has a great build to it, where it starts quiet and purposeful in its pacing, and then builds up gradually to a very exciting final third. Despite the slower pace (compared to his other two movies), I don't think Nope ever feels boring, and the fact it doesn't race towards its conclusion means you're kept in the dark for a good while about many of the things that conclusion will entail.Performances are good across the board. I really liked Daniel Kaluuya's role, and he's great at playing a kind of character he's never played before; also not the kind of quiet, withdrawn character you usually see as a film's protagonist (but for reasons made clear in the film, it makes sense and works with the plot). Elsewhere, there are other great actors who I wish had maybe gotten the chance to be in the film a little more, but everyone does well with what they're given (saying any more might be spoiling something).There's a huge subplot here that might not be a subplot; it's given a lot of focus and I only understand very superficially how it relates to the main plot. That and a couple of other small elements feel a bit under-utilised or under-explored, but what is actually in the movie is very good, so it wasn't too much of a bother that it couldn't fully shed light on everything. And the film is just consistently engaging, and a real knockout technically - it looks and sounds amazing, and Peele really makes fantastic use of the biggest budget he's had yet.A few shortcomings aside, this is by and large a really exciting movie, and does well in combining plenty of familiar tropes and ideas before remixing them into something thrilling and unpredictable. It's kind of what you want out of every new release movie, but don't often get, and the more well-executed and original movies we get like this going forward, the better.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Pro\\'s:\\nDirector Jordan Peele continues his horror run, and he\\'s teamed up once more with past collaborator Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out) in this latest flick. Kaluuya\\'s OJ and his sister Emerald run a horse ranch out in California where they raise and train horses for Hollywood productions. But when strange events and an unwelcome visitor start materializing, things go from bad to worse. But really this movie is a Western disguised as an alien movie. (Nope and Cowoys & Aliens may be the only 2 movies that make up this genre). Or rather a Western about Westerns. OJ really comes to embody the good guy cowboy of the old Western movies that this film draws on, and which rent out OJ\\'s horses for their productions. He faces off against the menace astride his steed, defending his land; at one point there\\'s a silhouette shot of him framed by a hewn timber archway that just screams John Wayne. His sister Emerald as the trusty sidekick, cinematographer Antlers as the Old Gun who has one more in him, faded child star Jupe as the naïve local who\\'s not the man for the job: all the stock archetypes are there. But they\\'re drawn and fleshed out compellingly. The effects here are top notch, the CGI is impeccable. Most notable perhaps on the chimp \"Gordy\", whose animation is on par with the recent Planet of the Apes trilogy. Even still, in the 2 instances Gordy is close up and looking right at the camera, the film does a very smart thing. In one instance there is a glare coming from behind Gordy, due to studio lights, creating a hazy camera flare. In the other, a translucent table cloth obscures Gordy\\'s face. Both tricks serve to keep us from getting a 100% close up direct look at him, which is a skillful trick to really sell the CGI just in case our now-jaded eyes can tell it\\'s not real. The result is a completely believable, fully photo-real digital figure. The more narrative aspect of this trick is how it ties in with the broader motif of not looking directly at a wild being. This applies to both Gordy and the alien. In this film, those who do are not long for this world. It\\'s the most direct example of the movie\\'s theme of watching and being watched, which it returns to over and over again. OJ\\'s ancestor is the first actor in the first motion picture. Jupe is a former child actor. Mirror balls recur at different points- on set, as the TMZ reporter\\'s helmet, and the one OJ is making himself at the ranch. These balls, which cause the viewer to see themselves in the reflection, always presage something bad about to happen. Jupe himself refers to the aliens as \"viewers\". The alien is able to sense being watched. It\\'s mouth/eye/orifice thing revealed towards the end of the movie is like a camera shutter, repeatedly pulsing and seemingly clicking over, even as the people on the ground record it with their own lenses. The TMZ reporter, unconcerned at his impending death, begs only that it be filmed. The security cameras OJ installs around the ranch are always recording, scanning the skies. Watching and being watched, viewing and being viewed, is the main \"message\" of the film. But refreshingly, Peele takes a more subtle approach here than in previous outings Get Out and Us. The themes here are less in your face and more woven in this time around, a sign of growing maturity from the relatively novice director. The less overt messaging is appreciated. The cinematic lineage of the film is all over the screen. Peele uses the big open sky how Spielberg used the vast expanse of open water in Jaws. OJ ends up tagging the alien with a string of flags much like Jaws\\' Quint tags the titular shark with barrels. You\\'ll almost expect OJ to say \"We\\'re gonna need a bigger horse.\" All alone at the isolated ranch, pitted against strange occurrences and this unknown malevolence, there are big Coen brothers and M. Night Shyamalan vibes. A Serious Man, The Village, and Signs come to mind. Hell, add a few frogs to the falling objects and you could throw Magnolia in there. A few puzzling things introduced in the first half that will have you scratching your head, such as those objects falling from the sky and Jupe\\'s wishing well, pay off in the second half satisfyingly. It all intensifies and delivers a thrilling second half that\\'s as exciting as it is suspenseful.Cons:\\nIf the second half is a wild ride, the first half is a slow burn. Too slow, to where it almost fizzles out. The movie really takes its time setting up. And while good movies will often do that, they do it while building suspense and anticipation. That\\'s the difference better editing might have made here. The first half of this movie starts to plod along and really drag until we finally get to Jupe\\'s \"Star Lasso Experience\" catastrophe, and that arguably could have been the ending climax of a shorter film! The film runs 130 minutes, and it really should be about 90. The first hour could easily be a half hour and deliver everything we need. There\\'s a tighter, more focused hour and a half movie in here, but unfortunately the first half is weighed down with a lot of track laying that just isn\\'t very compelling. And for as good as the second half is once the ball gets rolling, it sort of doesn\\'t know when to end. By the time we get to the Jupiter\\'s Claim fiasco, the audience will likely believe they\\'re seeing the tragic climax. But that\\'s only about halfway through the film. There\\'s still a whole plan to hatch and execute with the alien. And while that plan plays out with action and suspense to spare, it\\'s seemingly a second ending. It\\'s almost as if the writers couldn\\'t pick an ending, so they went ahead with both. Not helping the lethargic pace is Daniel Kaluuya\\'s somber OJ. While he is ostensibly the star of this Western, and so the \"strong, silent type\" is called for, there\\'s taciturn and then there\\'s dull. And Kaluuya starts to slump over that line. His character is witnessing events that not only confirm alien life, but alien life that killed his father and is directly threatening his own life and livelihood. You wouldn\\'t know it from his face or demeanor though, even mid-showdown with a floating death monster. A person, any person, would simply be more affected by these events. I\\'m sure the argument can and will be made that OJ is being the stern unflappable cowboy, but I\\'m not convinced. Maybe an \"oh my god\" or an \"oh sh_t\" here and there. How \\'bout an eyebrow raise? A drop more deadpan and the Kristen Stewart comparisons will start swirling. It worked in Get Out, but here it\\'s just a little puzzling. (As a side note, I\\'m not sure I believe OJ\\'s father would have been killed by the falling nickel either. His cadaver is shown with a gash in his head and x-rays of the nickel having been imbedded inside (!) his skull. A nickel dropped from any height, even an airplane, is not splitting a skull. Draw blood yes, maybe fracture a bone at the right angle. But break a skull and embed in a brain? A nickel is not doing that kind of damage unless fired out of a gun.) Another part of the movie that doesn\\'t quite jive is the backstory of Jupe and the monkey incident. Ostensibly, the analogy here is that some animals can\\'t be tamed, and trying to will only lead to disaster. That\\'s true for Gordy, that\\'s true for the horse OJ\\'s father observes in a flashback, and that\\'s true for the alien. Jupe pays the price for not learning that lesson the first time around with Gordy. But the analogy isn\\'t water tight, because OJ and his family hadn\\'t been trying to tame, or were even aware of, the alien. What are they being punished for? It\\'s a tenuous lesson that isn\\'t worth the disjointed B-story flashbacks. It ends up more of a distraction than anything else, even if it does deliver the most visceral horror in the movie.Bottom line: Nope is an interesting and strange film that manages some real suspense and kicks on the back end. A unique take on both Westerns and UFO movies, Peele\\'s quickly building himself a reputation as a meticulous crafter. It\\'s a shame the setup is a little bloated, and Daniel Kaluuya\\'s too dull for most of it to inject much needed life into the first half. A re-cut could make a much sharper thriller out of this movie, but it has some interesting things to say about Hollywood and our content consumption culture. When it does finally step on the gas it proves it can execute. 6.5 out of 10 stars.'},\n",

What's the meaning of it?Not like I need movies to have a meaning, but this one wasn't even pleasurable to watch: the story makes no sense and doesn't go anywhere, characters are not interesting and act unrealistically, the pacing is slow and disjointed, there isn't enough horror nor comedy, and the cinematography was just all right.It definitely seems like this movie only got made because it was attached to a known name, as nobody would have ever greenlit it otherwise. The idea on paper just sounds weak and stupid. It's basically a Shyamalan production, but with a less catchy mystery.Most of the movie is justified by characters doing the most stupid and unrealistic things, which nobody in their right mind would ever do. I really wish I could say more to prove my point, but I don't wanna write any spoilers here. I just hope nobody wastes their time watching this.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'From a visual standpoint this movie is amazing. The camera work is great. That\\'s about it. The plot was insanely boring & there were parts that had zero to do with the main plot (The Monkey attack scene for example) that were the most interesting scenes although it wasn\\'t necessary. The acting was cool but seeing those characters in other films where they\\'ve really excelled made it extremely hard to like them in this movie due to the lack of common sense that was written for their roles. THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. There was nothing scary about it at all. It was a \"Get Rich Quick\" themed movie. They had no type of game-plan to fight the Alien. The entire focus was put on how to get this on camera to sell it and make money. Due to the way this was written it made it very easy to root for the alien which provided one of my favorite scenes in which it showered the house with Blood and everything else it consumed. Would\\'ve loved to learn more about the alien other than the fact that it hid behind a cloud that doesn\\'t move...that is until it randomly transformed into one of the worst monster designs I\\'ve seen in a movie. It went from a Flying Saucer to a Hot Air Balloon with ZERO explanation. The transformation literally came out of nowhere and was very unnecessary. It didn\\'t need this new form to wreck havoc earlier in the movie but now all of a sudden it\\'s mandatory when it\\'s only 3 people left for it to hunt down ??? NOPE is the perfect title for this film because of the way everything played out. In my honest opinion Jordan Peele is now 1/4 on movies. \"Hype Culture\" will make this movie successful but if you eliminate his other work of art and go into this movie with a fresh mind you will be extremely disappointed.'},\n",

I knew from the trailer I was going to dislike it but my friend literally begged me to watch it.Why? Here are my reasons:\\n-Sloooooooooww, oh my gosh this was one of the slowest movies I have ever seen. This movie pretended to have immense depth and suspense but was really just trying to insert the word \" nope\" wherever it could... Frankly, if I were in these situations, I wouldn\\'t have said anything! There is a scene where hooligans are on their property (keep in mind it is a FARM) they are taunting the owners... this was unbelievably stupid and the best way for them to get shot, which they absolutely would have been.-Lesson, the lesson as I understand it that they were trying to teach was that we need to watch out for the subjugation of animals as it might bite us in the future. They have a horse ranch... PULEAAAAAZE (massive eye roll) you have got to be kidding me. Blackfish got this message across a lot better, that being said, it was immediately clear why the whale did what it did. This movie just makes it happen because a chimp just loses it for no reason. Nonsense. Oh, and this scene was duuuuuumb. Really?! There is no security at a tv show stage? REALLY?! The entire cast/production team/audience just sat there and watched other people get killed until it was their turn?! ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME?!-Characters. Oh Lord, they were awful. They even try to virtue signal at the beginning of the movie but don\\'t follow through with any reason why. The sister won\\'t be quiet, she is awful to listen to and obviously a money-grubbing moronic huckster who couldn\\'t give a fig about horses. The one guy who does seem competent is the brother and he has virtually no lines, I truly think they did that so that we would appear wise and brooding, but why? It actually detracted from the story. How am I supposed to relate to the guy? Why do I care if he dies? I actually really like this actor, he had a small part in Sicario and I thought he did a great job! What the heck?!I\\'ll stop there for now, but there is certainly more. These were just my immediate gripes. I looked for reviews online and there are reviewers I will never listen to again because they complimented this movie. I hope they learn their lesson. This movie was absolute garbage, I will never get those two hours back, so you are welcome that I took this proverbial bullet for you. Do yourself a favor and go see something that doesn\\'t suck, Alien, Aliens, Predator, Meet Joe Black, heck go see Twister! Just don\\'t see this movie, and if you do, let someone else pay for it. Don\\'t give money to people that ruin movies.'},\n",

You are expected a knock at the door or some threat but nope, just stay indoors and ur safe. Pretty lame.The cinematography was cool at times. The scenes looked cool, the wavey figures scattered across the landscape was creative, and the sound editing was pretty cool.The plot didn't have much payoffs throughout. First the main characters arcs had nothing to do with the alien. Like what does OJ's desire to protect his Dad's legacy have to do with the alien? Can someone help me see it? The Asian kid who was traumatized by the chimp? What did his arc have to do with the alien? I was expecting them to show some twisted desire to be at the mercy of a murderous creature but no payoff on that. All in all I could have been the main character and it wouldn't have made a difference.I saw a couple reviews that tried to make sense of the movie and find a deeper message. One looked at exploiting animals for amusement and another for our preoccupation to film stuff. Didn't buy either really. Not much depth to the movie.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I have enjoyed a few of Jordan Peele's movies...I was extremely disappointed with this. The script was very long and there was too much dialog without meaning. It's like a Stephen King book...too much filler. I know some movies are a slow burn...but this didn't even have a match lit after 45 slow minutes in.Instead of so much blah blah blah he could have put in some action in the first 30 minutes to draw and keep your attention. There wasn't even any suspense to catch you.Sadly the acting was sub-bar and I nearly fell asleep a couple of times. It took me about 5 hours to watch a 2 hour movie. I had to keep pausing and walk around.Hopefully his next one isn't this long and dull! I want to entertained when I watch a movie. Especially a long one.\"},\n",

The themes it touches on, the family bonds we can all relate to, the culture we all are apart of....they are all here, wrapped once again in an entertaining and surprising film. To me it's like the Jackie Brown of Jordan Peele's filmography and will be appreciated as such as he continues on his path of creating amazing films. I went into it not knowing much about the plot and that's the best way to do it, so I will refrain from spoiling anything that could give it away. The cinematography is beautiful. The set designs are wonderful. The score is fantastic. But Daniel Kaluuya and Keeke Palmer are amazing. They make this movie.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"NOPE didn't sit as well as I would've hoped when it came to the story. The film felt slightly long due to the first and third acts feeling fast and somewhat stuffed with a lot of goings ons while the second act felt very slow and drawn out. The long parts put me into a state of boredom, and even further than that, once the reveal of the antagonist happened, the magic and tension disappeared. Before that tension disappeared I found there was some good tension built up due to the soundtrack, but again, things fell short. As for the horror parts, I assumed there would be more than just the ones shown in the commercial, and while there was, again a lot of the horror/magic disappeared once the antagonist was shown. I did find the acting to be very engaging. Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer each brought great energy to their roles, and the supporting actors were equally enjoyable.Overall, it is a decent film which could be another masterpiece but the opportunity was wasted.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Jordan Peele seems to have the same career trajectory of M Night Shamylan. This is what happens when you prematurely call someone a genius after a great 1st film and they spend the rest of their careers trying to replicate what everyone loved before. Each film progressively becoming worse and more incoherent or uninteresting.The film starts off on a TV set with a monkey in a birthday hat covered in blood. You would think since the film starts off here and is seen in flashbacks, it would be pivotal to the plot. Nope. It could be taken out and not effect the story at all. Ironically this side story was far more interesting than the main plot.*Spoilers* The movie starts off building some good tension and having a suitably creepy atmosphere. Then the plot twist happens. What the main characters believe is a U. F. O. Carrying aliens with unknown intent turns out to be a giant floating jellyfish like creature that is just feeding on local livestock.I was actually still on board with this revelation. The creepy atmosphere was gone but I can still enjoy a good creature feature. Unfortunately the film started off not showing much of the creature. It was seen in far away shots or obscured by clouds. As the film drags on, the creature is seen much closer and for longer periods of time. It does not look good or imposing at all, especially in the climax when it opens up and looks like a series of sheets flapping in the wind.One other annoying aspect of the movie was how it forced the knowledge of the animal trainers like they were the only ones who could have faced this creature using their unique experience. They avoided one encounter by remembering a horse in the beginning being spooked by seeing its reflection, so they automatically assume they would follow the same advice they gave and not look the creature in the eye. This saves them from attack on numerous occasions as the creature is trying to feed but they don\\'t look directly at it. First of all, a hungry animal is not going to care if you look at it or not as it is trying to devour you. Secondly, even though horses may not like direct eye contact, there are plenty of animals that this would not bother. Why would this creature not of planet earth follow the behavior of one very specific earth animal?One other odd behavior is that the creature eats a fake horse with a rainbow colored banner attached to it. This causes the creature to spit it out with the explanation it must have gotten stuck and the creature will think twice if it saw that again. This was such a big plot point that toward the finale, the main character O. J. escapes an attack and is called a \"genius\" because as he was being chased and while on horseback, reveals a rainbow colored banner that trails behind him, causing the creature to stop. I was fine with this given the explanation that it wouldn\\'t attack remembering it got stuck the last time. What annoyed me was that the finale saw a giant balloon with the same rainbow banners hanging out of 4 different sides fly up into the air and the creature swallows it and it explodes. All of a sudden, when they need to end the movie, they ignore the rules they set and just continue onward.I really wanted to like the movie. It started off good but progressively got worse. It was an over 2 hour long movie that could have had a lot of filler taken out to be an hour long Twilight Zone of Outer Limits episode and would have been much better for it.It\\'s almost as if the film is warning you not to waste your time watching it. Nope.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Funny how the two movies that came to mind for me are mentioned in the first few reviews here. I thought of Tremors and Signs. I thought it was just like either of those films but on steroids. I agree still feel like I am trying to make sense of what I just watched. Something just felt off about the film. There definitely was some slow or boring parts but that wasn't it. It was like maybe how less is more when it comes to Jaws and this just felt like Peele just kept trying to add more spice then some more. Until finally it was like really the flying saucer does that now? It was a pretty decent very different film. It just doesn't strike up enough and seems like a one and done for sure. I don't know maybe Peele was just really into the Twilight Zone as a kid and now trying to put his fantasy to the big screen. That is what it felt like. I don't think it comes off as endearing or pretentious as he might think. It still was a good effort though.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Nope (2022) :\\nMovie Review -If I say Jordan Peele has his own cinema and you are up for it, then add Nope with a big YES to the list. Peele\\'s directorial debut, \"Get Out\" (2017), left us stunned. That kind of horror cinema was missing in this \"The Conjuring\" era, and Peele was smart enough to realise that before critics and smart movie lovers did. His next film, \"Us\", again had us all immersed in a horror universe. Peele was no longer an ordinary director after these two films, so how could he be with his third? There was no way Nope could have gotten a \\'No\\' from the viewers, and I am adding myself to the league of fans right here at this moment. Nope is truly a Jordan Peele kind of cinema with a spine-chilling cinematic experience made only for IMAX viewing.Set in a west-side ranch, Nope revolves around two siblings who own the ranch. OJ Haywood Jr. (Daniel Kaluuya) is an unsuccessful horse trainer, and his sister, Em Haywood (Keke Palmer), seeks fame and fortune in Hollywood as a singer, actor, host, and what not. Both witness a series of mysterious events and then learn about an unidentified flying thing (a big saucer). Their attempts to capture evidence through videos and photos are shown throughout the film, but it\\'s also about saving their own lives against the flying monster. Meanwhile, the two are joined by a tech salesman, Angel (Brandon Perea), and a renowned cameraman, Holst (Michael Wincott). Jupe (Steven Yeun) is one of the major witnesses to the same activities, but there is something wrong between him and those siblings for some unknown business forsaken reasons.Frankly speaking, Jordan Peele\\'s script has nothing good for you. Actually, it is not a film that should be viewed for its storyline. I mean, these alien and spacecraft things are too old, no? Coincidentally, I got to see Steven Spielberg\\'s ET: The Extra Terrestrial\\'s (1982) 40th Anniversary teaser before Nope, and that reminded me how old this Alien thing is now. Not to forget Ridley Scott\\'s \"Alien\" (1979), which makes it 3 years older. From that, I remember, Nope is the best formulaic \\'Alien-concept\\' film in recent years. Actually, best after Scott\\'s sci-fi horror, its blockbuster sequel \"Aliens\" (1986) by Cameron, and John Carpenter\\'s \"The Thing\" (1982). I didn\\'t go back to evergreen classics like \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951), \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1956) and \"Forbidden Planet\" (1957). Nope lacks the story-driven and groundbreaking cinema like those three films, but with this budget, it\\'s on above par level. Nope was never meant to be a story-driven cinema, at least that\\'s how I see it. It was supposed to be an atmospheric and environment-driven cinema, and it succeeds in doing so.Daniel Kaluuya excels in the lead role, just like he always has in every Jordan Peele film. His expressions are genuine, and several depressing scenes are made more intense on screen by his incorporation of his own persona. In her very first scene, Keke Palmer had a blast and gave a caution about the upcoming storm. However, she also gets into an intense mode later, where she does an even better job. Steven Yeun\\'s character has less space that could\\'ve been extended, but sadly remains the least explored. On his behalf, Brandon Perea brings some real fun in a much-needed and important supporting role. The small roles by Michael Wincott, Keith David, Wrenn Schmidt and child artist Jacob Kim are really fine.Coming back to Peele\\'s technical team, as mentioned above, Nope isn\\'t a story-driven film, but a cinematic experience. Why? Because the technical aspects of the film make it a rich viewing experience. The background score, cinematography, visual effects, production design, sound and editing, every single technical aspect of the film is outstanding. It may not frighten you as much as \"Jaws,\" \"Alien,\" or \"The Thing\" because it is not a mind-bending film, but it has its moments of terror. You will feel frightened for a while and might not look UP, like the characters, that\\'s how engaging and atmospheric it is. At moments, you feel like, why are you scared if there is no ghost or evil face up there? It\\'s just a flying saucer with some screaming noises, and yet your heartbeat escalates. Why? This is where the victory of Nope lies.Jordan Peele has become a director to look up to. People who really want to make a good horror movie should take lessons from him, and I\\'m sure he will charge less just like the budget of his movies. Nope is still a far more high-budget film compared to Get Out and Us, but this was needed. The money goes where it\\'s due. Peele did not waste a single peel. Nope is his masterclass in the director\\'s chair. There is no story practically, and there is no theoretical appeal either, yet his skilful vision strikes gold! Nope may go down in the history books as one of the finest experiences at the movies as far as moderate-budget sci-fi horror flicks are concerned. Try and watch this film in IMAX because that\\'s where the real show of this comes to visibility. That\\'s how it is shot, modified, visualised, and presented. Don\\'t miss this visually stunning horror show by the new master of the genre. Nope might just be his best work to date. That\\'s a big thing to say YES!RATING - 7/10*'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Writer/directors almost the kind that writes the entire movie alone often fall into a situation whereby the final screenplay is not good and they are too proud to ask someone to have a look at it and do re-writes. M Night Shyamalan is a perfect example. After the original great movie Sixth Sense (1999) and the slightly above average Signs (2002) Newsweek put him on its cover with the title \"The Next Spielberg\". Since then he has been consistently writing bad movies to the point that the Big five movie studios would not distribute his movies let alone produce them.Mr. Peele started very well with Get Out. I haven\\'t seen Us but I am certain its not on the level of Get Out. Nope follows the same trajectory of going down in quality. I did not understand what he was trying to do. I am still thinking the movie has a hidden meaning. I do not understand the purpose of the movie. I mean if he wanted to do a movie of people who record alien crafts in the sky why not just get to the point. Besides I have read lots of UFO books and Mr. Peele made up all that stuff. You can skip this movie or repeat Get Out.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I will preface my quick review by saying, I enjoyed Get Out and did not care for Us at all. Nope is fairly straight forward sci-fi, for Peele. It has its nuance, of course, but it's far more grounded and coherent than Us and not quite as provocative as Get Out. What it tries to say in metaphor works about as well as it's stand alone story, but neither stand out as anything all that profound. I like the attention paid to the setting and location, it's used well within the story and fits perfectly with the atmosphere. The unique approach to the alien/ ufo depiction is refreshing and while I would have appreciated more details about it's origin and backstory- it does leave you with some mystery which is what you would expect from a movie like this. I also enjoyed the fact that no characters spontaneously develop superpowers and the end doesn't conclude with an implication of a never ending franchise to come.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Keke Palmer is annoying as usual, but I think they had her act that way in an attempt to keep some kind of energy or life in this movie going. It didn\\'t work, in fact her sudden outbursts and shouting were bigger jumpscares than the actual jumpscares. Daniel Kaluuya\\'s character has a reason to be depressed but his character was annoyingly depressing and reticent because when we need him to scream, he never did it. When we needed Keke to shut up, she didn\\'t. It\\'s crazy. Luckily it just makes Kaluuya sexy because I like laidback chill men, but that isn\\'t the point or purpose of his character being a tongue tied, emotionally absent dullard. Hence him saying \"nope\" instead of screaming. In fact I\\'m not quite sure what the purpose is, other than to make him the underdog hero, the timid depressed person who outsmarts a big scary monster.They strategically put the most exciting/disturbing part smack. Dab. In the middle of the movie, which is ironically the least important part of the movie entirely, when the monkey goes crazy. No one in the comments is really explaining the monkey/horse/Steven Yuen thing because they don\\'t want to ruin the spoilers, but seriously there is nothing to spoil, and the entire connection between the trifecta prolongs the movie running time about 30-40 minutes in all honesty. It\\'s a 3/10 back story mainly because of its anti-climactic uselessness, but yes it makes total sense, regardless, so kudos still to the originality; however that storyline or plot driver could\\'ve been written 100 pages shorter and executed in about 5-10 consecutive minutes runtime as a whole.The most creative part of this movie is the worst part of this movie, which is the setting. An empty ranch in the wild west desert. It was unsettling, as intended, but not for the reason it intended. It wasn\\'t creepy; it was just lacking aesthetics and character and I never got used to it. That\\'s all. At least the rural location in Signs by that insufferable M Night dude had character, in that the location was the main element of the film. I don\\'t see why this film takes place where it does. They can train horses anywhere. It\\'s a horse, not a lion or an eagle. It doesn\\'t need to be in the middle of nowhere lol. Plus because their ranch is so vast, it requires Keke Palmer to be even louder and unbearable as usual so that her onscreen fellows can hear her character talk from the gate to the house or from the car to the house. They really brought the ghetto to the range, and it was misplaced and unfunny, and why is she masculine. Can\\'t she be a tough chick without being MASCULINE. Yes, look at Lara Croft, Hermione, Trinity from Matrix, Catwoman, heck even Wonderwoman, Ziyi Zhang. They are all tough and still feminine, Keke. Jesus. Can\\'t she be a confident, representative black woman without being profane and improper? And that accent. Sweet mother. Was that supposed to be--endearing...? That attitude is not as relatable as you people in Hollywood seem to think it is. And it\\'s not a good representation of her acting skills, either, if they exist at all, since she\\'s constantly playing a stereotype which might just come naturally to her. I don\\'t think she was acting, do you? That\\'s just how she talks. In fact...Her character Em is not a good representation of anything. Em is always of no help to her shy onscreen brother, who does all the work and masterminding, strangely, since Keke\\'s character would have you think SHE\\'D be the hero since she acts all tough. It was just pointless and disappointing.The final 30 or so minutes of the film was a ridiculous, unexhilarating alien-chase, with them setting up cameras and pep talk and big boss fight rehearsal literally done in a montage over triumph music. Like nerds in an 80s movie compiling their plan to lose their virginity or defeat the school bully once and for all. Honestly it was like watching Mr. Miyagi train the Karate Kid. Was it supposed to be funny like a satire, or were they being serious? I paused at that point to write this movie.The main issue with this film is that it\\'s pointless, ugly, and mostly boring, despite the events and budget. I have no idea why Peele is doing an alien movie anyway. Put the camera down and enjoy your riches. Do not waste it on silly crap. Alien movies are not worth the budget and they\\'re ridiculous but still need to make sense in their own ridiculous way. Peele is better off doing a zombie apocalypse movie or hey. Maybe make a movie about guys in the 80s trying to lose their virginity. Those are cliche movies that are still interesting because they are foolproof. Peele is clearly overdoing the \"HAHA look at me now, I\\'m making movies! And not just ANY kind of movies\" thing when it comes to whatever naysayers or insecurities he has and is biting off more than he can chew. Leave the silly horrible sci-fi stuff to M Night, bro. You lost any target audience you might have had because you confused and bored them to death.'},\n",

Acting: the lead might as well be a rando black guy off the street, hes almost katatonic most of the film, feels like im watching the same guy from get out, the sister is loud and annoying, nothing worth mentioning from the side characters.2. Cringe: most of the scenes where stuff other than the plot is being discussed, as expected in modern hollywood the cast is all very diverse and there are not-at-all subtle progressive moments here and there but theyre very tolerable, the sister is unbearable every time she speaks tho.3. Nonsense: okay here we go, the asian guy has proof of a literal gigantic saucer swooping up horses and he decides to unveil it at a show where theres 20ish people in attendance... ok.... the creature doesnt eat you if you dont look at it, protag figures this out based on nothing. Also, if you do look at it (like he did at the end) it engages this mesmerizing display and again doesnt eat you because reasons. Also, the camera guy decides to set up on a hill totally exposed under a tent because reasons, he then wanders out into the open tooo... get a good shot, which will inevitably get sucked up and destroyed upon expelling. They also set up a million of those dancing ballons because thats apparently the best way to tell where the saucer is, even tho if it affects power its close enough to see anyway, also, someone set up literally 50 of those without getting swooped up because reasons. The balloon at the end violently explodes instead of just deflating because reasons. The bits and pieces of indigestible stuff shoot out instead of just falling for reasons(dad had to die somehow), there are several other issues about the alien but you can suspend your disbelief there.Generally poor planning and decision making and inconsistency from the creature. One time its super efficient and swooping people up and at other times the sister and tech guy casually run up to the van and the van even starts even tho it was right above it but whatever.4. Good stuff: the chimp bit was unsettling and very well done, didnt think i could be scared of a chimp but kudos to Peele, i was. It also made perfect sense to me the first time i watched it, the asian kid believed he had a gift since the chimp chose not to kill him for whatever reason, the upright shoe has no other meaning than the fact that its a striking reminder of the incident thats why the AZN guy had it framed. This led him to believe he could use this \"gift\" to make a show out of the creature which backfired. The screams coming from the clouds are horrifying. The idea that there are people alive slushing around in the creatures guts fighting each other over air and screaming as soon as they manage to draw breath is pure horror. Camera work is excellent too, the blood shower scene at the house made my skin crawl, and the way it blocks out the rain over the truck is creepy as hell. However, the scenes i just mentioned are the only times this movie is good. And after the bloodbath at the house it takes a nosedive into bloated and cringey illogical convoluted territory and ends with a fizzle, after putting you to sleep.Also i think the unfurled design is cool but nonsensical, why would it have that mesmerizing \"eye\"? Say its for mating or whatever, why does it flash it at the protag and the balloon?I think this is a classic case of director who made it big having too much freedom. This movie needed someone to control his ambition since hes not able to do it himself. Theres a scary monster movie hidden in here, nothing more, but its 40 minutes shorter and features far less of the annoying sister, progressive messages and poor attempts at humor, and far more of the blood curdling screams, creepy saucer swooping noises, shots inside the alien/creature and shots where we get the idea of the suffering its victims go thru.'},\n",

There was one great movie, and the rest have been lacking that \"it\" factor.This movie was just too slow and really did not hold one\\'s attention or interest, sadly. I am unsure what the point of this flick was either as it seemed a mashup of several genres, but didn\\'t really tie itself together in any cohesive manner.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'This is my first review here, but I just had to register because ... OMG ... this movie is so bad. And why is it that the average rating here is 7.0? As a side note, for quite some time now I have observed that ratings on IMBD can no longer be trusted as many bad or mediocre films end up with ratings of 7+ (see Bullet Train for instance). Is that production companies paying click farms to up-vote their movies? But I digress.First off, I really liked Get Out and - to some extent - Us. Especially Get Out was witty, entertaining, and even a little scary. Unfortunately, none of these adjectives apply to NOPE. I have read some reviewers claiming that we fail to see the deeper meaning about \"spectacle\" and \"commercialization\", well, I counter those by ... deep? Really? I mean where have these reviewers been the past decade or so? Perhaps going through junior high? The commercialization of spectacle and its critique have been around since the 70s in various shapes and forms, so this is nothing new, and certainly nothing that this movie contributes anything valuable to.The story is mostly boring and most elements are derivative. For about an hour or so, exactly nothing happens, except an interesting flashback to some monkey running amok on a TV set (perhaps if the main movie had been focused on this, we might have something vaguely interesting) while building (or at least trying to) up some tension with regard to an ominous UFO hidden in a stationary cloud, from which is seems to emerge (like clockwork) to participate to some rural Buffalo Bill/alien show (unnoticed by anyone in the area thus far and also all the visitors who have seen the alien show over the years apparently are extraordinarily good secret keepers).Once the actual UFO appears, the disappointment is overwhelming and makes you want to get up from your seat and leave right there and then. But well, as I was not alone I sat through it till the end, not caring one bit whether the protagonists survived or died, although I really like Daniel Kaluuya as an actor. As for Keke Palmer, I was really hoping the aliens would get her rather sooner than later as her character is outright annoying, also partly due to her constant overacting.Then, for what seems like several minutes they try to photograph the UFO (to get the Oprah shot) with some camera pointing vertically upward from some kind of wishing well-type construction, and ... well ... the UFO obliges and diligently keeps flying right over this well, whose (electric) flash bulbs are not only strong enough to illuminate an object a couple hundred meters above (quite some flash) but miraculously keep working while everything else electric is being wiped out by the UFO\\'s conveniently built-in EMP.To be clear, I have no problem with dumb aliens or ridiculousness per se; for instance, Mars Attacks was hilarious, and when they eventually manage to beat the aliens by playing some old country song, hey, that was highly entertaining and comical. Why did this work there and not in NOPE? Because Mars Attacks was an actual comedy. It was funny and made you laugh. The only time when NOPE managed to make me smile was when I could finally get up from my seat and walk out of the cinema.'},\n",

End of the so-called new horror master. What a joke. Go back to comedy. The script was crap. It barely made sense. Like one guy sees something maybe moving in the sky they immediately decide to get high tech camera systems to film the UFO and make money. I could give like 20 examples just as stupid in this film. Don't waste your time, good movie midway, but sucks the rest and don't make sense. After watching the movie, I came to a conclusion that this trailer is better than the actual movie. Was extremely disappointed with the movie. Went into it knowing nothing, at the end I found out it was supposed to be a horror, but wasn't scary at all so I was surprised. The actors were. Bland, to the point that I dozed off a few times. Only good thing about it was the visuals, who ever is responsible for that, he is leagues above the rest of the crew, hats off to him/her. Our opinion (mine and the group I watched the movie with) is 3/10. I think 99% of the admirers of this movie are just zombies or I should say who don't have their own likes and dislikes. They are dead. They act as per the surrounding air. This movie is number one bad. The concept shown in this movie (actually I should say there is no concept) is very old. Nothing new. OMG. What had happened to people who say even a little good about this movie. I am really shocked that people are not so much free that they can think their own way. There is nothing nothing nothing in this movie. The most terrifying part of this movie was the start, best part the finish. A terrible attempt at doing a movie differently and it failed badly.

If you like slow burn thrillers this is the movie for you.Not only was the movie shot with such talent it makes me never want to pick up a camera, but the acting is amazing. Keke Palmer was a little annoying at the beginning but definitely came around. The I. T character was also amazing. But the stand out for me was Daniel Kaluuya. His acting was amazing and I really enjoyed his character. You could really see the pain in his eyes and could tell, he ain't the best with interacting with people.There are some really intense scenes in this movie and one gotcha moment that had me on the edge of my seat. And this is the perfect part to switch to the negatives.Warning spoilers.I just don't know how much I could watch it again. One of the scenes I wanted to see I got to see but there was a twist to it.(once you see the movie you will know what I am talking about) and after that twist the movie becomes a Jaws like movie and it's good but the flow was a little off. And then the opening scene that they keep on showing again. That could've been cut, it has a good message about how we as a society can monetize tragedy.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Jordan Peele\\'s third movie is both his most disturbing, most visually appealing, and most narratively complex movie yet. While definitely his slowest movie, Nope starts building suspense very early on, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. During every scene, no matter how trivial it may seem, there is always a sense of dread, as if anything might happen. And anything does happen. Nope has been referred to as Jordan Peele\\'s biggest movie yet, and this is true both visually and narratively. While Get Out and Us both had one main focus and source of horror, Nope touches upon multiple genres and stories throughout various cuts and scenes that are seemingly unrelated to the main antagonistic force of the movie, but still play a major part in the narrative. These various cuts also bring some \"reality horror\" into the movie, which is mostly absent in the main narrative. The realness in these scenes is far scarier than any alien or monster. The narrative structure also features some great character development and strong social commentary, commenting on people\\'s insatiable need capture spectacle on camera. \"The Oprah Shot\" as it is referred to in the movie.Visually, Nope is absolutely stunning. Every shot looks like it could be in a photo gallery. The use of empty space and images of the sky add to the feeling of dread and inescapability that make this movie so utterly unsettling. It also features some of the most disturbing and beautiful shots that I have ever scene. I truthfully didn\\'t know whether or not to feel horrified or awed by the absolute spectacle that I was witnessing. It was beyond anything I had ever seen before in a movie, and was only improved by the size of the theater screen. It also happens to feature some images that will make you whisper to yourself: \"Nope\".The odd narrative and magnificent cinematography are only bolstered by the strong performances from all members of it\\'s cast, and especially from Keke Palmer. Her eccentric performance was able to capture her characters natural charisma and ecstatic personality without losing the pain that the character carried. Her performance really developed the character and added another layer of emotion to the movie. While Daniel Kaluuya also delivers a good performance, it pales in comparison to the performance he delivered in Get Out. Brandon Perea also does a great job serving as a kind of comic relief, and Steven Yeun uses his limited screen time to best of his ability, stealing every scene he\\'s in.Nope is terrifying, funny, fun, bizarre, disturbing, beautiful, and overall brilliant. It is one of the best movies of 2022, and is my personal favorite of Jordan Peele\\'s filmography so far. It currently stands at an 87/100, but it could easily go up in the future.'},\n",

Both after a great first movie, Get Out for Peele and The Sixth Sense for the latter, keep delivering stinkers to us gullible horror fans. This probably happens because of the too many yes men these directors/writers are surrounded. This particular Nope is a more traditional B movie like they were used to make in the 50's if we compare it to the absurd Us, the previous Jordan's effort. What is the difference and why many are so negative about this one? For starters the old movies were shorter, rarely going over 90 minutes, this one drags terribly especially in the final act and for no particular reason. The whole primate under plot had also no meaning if not trying to be shocking, it was two terryfing minutes as a matter of fact but not related to the main story. Then, we are fond of old movies because we were so young and fascinated by those stories. Today's kids could not care less of B movies and UFOS and we are too old to be impressed. Now, I did not spend one cent to watch this Nope so no major regrets, if not the disappointment to see another potentially talented author slowly drifting away towards anonymity. My advice is skip this, if you watch it and agree with my considerations give me a thumb up next time you are here. Happy new year!\"},\n",

It's dated, boring and I just couldn't enjoy her performance one bit.The rest of the cast were ok , but forced in, I've never known an electronics shop have the power to get into your system but I guess it's just the one guy going rouge.If this is a thriller then it's ok but if it's a horror it's straight up bad, it's not scary, not remotely.

But this time they don\\'t do it because they can\\'t get out or communicate with the outside, but because they want all the money.

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"I'm a big Jordan Peele fan, and here he ultimately delivers another good horror and it is definitely worth persevering through!I agree with some of the other reviews, there were scenes that were really slow moving even the speech seemed slow and in all honesty there were times I was about to walk. In a number of scenes there was dialogue that I didn't quite understand what the outcome was... however this may all have been very intentional as it did somewhat serve to distract from the fact that the movie is about an alien and I got quite invested in that towards the end.There's a couple of scenes that nod to Tom\\nCruise's War of the Worlds and also a nod to real life chimpanzee victim Charla Nash.The end is good although I am not sure if this was the plan or if this was a spur of the moment decision by OJs sister. Again that's because there were conversations that I didn't understand. Also the film director getting eaten for no reason seemed strange, I thought maybe his footage would drop back out hence his sacrifice but that didn't happen (maybe it did after the credits but I didn't wait)But it was very suspenseful and the acting was great from both Keke Palmer and Daniel Kaluuya so overall a good movie and worth the watch!!\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'There\\'s some intriguing bits here and there, but I ultimately found it unsatisfying. Keith David and Steven Yeun are the only two likeable characters. This isn\\'t inherently a negative, as well written, unlikable characters can be a good idea, but I wouldn\\'t call these well written. Mostly annoying unfortunately. Daniel Kaluuya\\'s character, OJ, doesn\\'t seem to care about anyone or anything, responding in a series of \"Mhm\\'s\" or \"Yep\\'s\" or \"Nope\\'s.\" He\\'s more interesting than a standard, cliche protagonist in that sense, but I found it apathetic and annoying. Keke Palmer plays his sister, contrasting him as a louder annoying person. Their acting was very good and sold these characters as their own people completely. I just sadly found those people distractingly off putting and never cared what might happen to them.The most intriguing parts are near the beginning and middle as the story sets up a lot. Not every film has to tie everything up for its audience, but this film cast so many metaphorical lines out that all came back empty for me. There\\'s an interesting bit with a sitcom in the 90\\'s that ultimately serves to teach us \"animals react to their environment,\" like our \\'antagonist\\' and I would have liked to see that developed more. The final act of the film starts to pick up the pace as our main characters prepare their plan. That part felt fun but was very short lived as it devolved into a sort of adventure scene with old corny adventure music. And in comes the man with the mirror helmet. A cool intriguing visual, until Keke Palmer quickly helps us understand, \"He\\'s TMZ!\" And immediately, all intrigue was gone.Spectacle: a visually striking performance or display. They mention spectacle multiple times, so maybe the whole point is to show you these \"spectacles\" that don\\'t amount to anything like you thought they would. You thought Mirror Helmet was special and would potentially expand the plot? No he\\'s just paparazzi. You thought the opening sitcom was special and would potentially expand the plot? No it\\'s just something that happened. You thought the inside of the \\'beast\\' would be explored and potentially explained? No, it\\'s just a \\'beast\\' that will die and the film will end. Does every film need to fully explain itself? No, there are masterful examples in David Lynch\\'s work. Sometimes just having something mysterious is what\\'s so intriguing. But this had no intrigue. It was a simple story about \"UFO Abductions\" that our characters wanted to capture on film.Lets think about \"Get Out\" for a moment. We start the film thinking its one thing, and suddenly it surprises us and takes us for a ride that we didn\\'t really expect. Where in contrast, \"Nope\" starts the film on a wild ride you didn\\'t expect, but then devolves into the film you feared it would be. There wasn\\'t really anything surprising or engaging or impactful. Or scary. The story just keeps moving forward without any profound meaning. While some might find that clever, in the end it was executed like a mediocre, run of the mill, forgettable teen summer flick. I don\\'t understand what people are praising. While there were some cool moments, the story and lack of a deeper plot made me feel like Daniel Kaluuya\\'s character: apathetic and tired.'},\n",

Fantastic cinematography, Kaluuya and Palmer are fantastic, their chemistry is great and their acting is very strong.Sadly, the real problem here is the story. When the \"reveal\" happens, it automatically makes a seemingly important part of the story confusing and leaves you wondering why it was even in there. It became convoluted, in terms of the motivation of the characters and even of the main threat. It was so dissapointing coming from Peele, the man who brought us the great twist in the masterful Get Out that this very promising movie devolved into standards territory.6/10 overall, I definitely recommend watching it in the theater for the best experience but you might feel a bit underwhelmed at the end.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'I\\'ve seen all of Jordan Peele\\'s three films and out of them all, Nope is definitely the most intriguing and gripping. Peele always creates unpredictable, fresh, original horror stories for the screen, a concept that isn\\'t too common nowadays. His films are always great at subverting your expectations, because I love that the film trailer was modest with revealing the entire plot and horror concepts.The main themes of spectacle and exploitation is insightful cautionary tale storytelling. Both themes convey the driving force behind mankind\\'s decisions and willingness to partake in messed up, corrupt situations for one\\'s own entertainment, financial benefit, or personal gain. That is true horror.I liked the huge focus on character development at the film\\'s start and in the rising action. The core characters OJ (Daniel Kaluuya), Emerald (Keke Palmer), Jupe (Steven Yeun), and Angel (Brandon Perea) are fleshed out as three-dimensional characters, where we quickly grow to like and care about them. All the acting was terrific and there was good cast chemistry! The sibling bond between Palmer and Kaluuya\\'s respective characters is genuine and believable. Also, I liked the interspersed comedic moments with these characters\\' interactions.There\\'s two disturbingly frightening, shocking scenes in Nope. First is Jupe\\'s flashback memory scene of \"Gordy\\'s Home\" sitcom tv show set massacre caused by a predatory, aggressively violent chimpanzee. Extremely scary and unsettling. Using a snippet of this scene for the intro scene is brilliant for establishing the tense, horrific, and frightening tone occurring in key moments throughout the film. Second: the next horrifying scene sequence happens during a debut show of the Star Lasso Experience, where Jupe, his wife and kids, and over 30 theme park audience visitors and park employees are swallowed up into the spaceship/UFO. We then see and hear the alarming, traumatizing aftermath of this. Minimal gore is used yet it is still powerfully gut-wrenching what we the viewer see and hear. We hear the screaming and bone-crunching pain they are experiencing as we witness the victims trapped and horrifically realizing they are going to die a slow, painful death, and be eventually fatally crushed, then consumed in the alien organism\\'s confined, claustrophobic-inducing digestive organs. Sheer terror of a scene, traumatic, terrifying and disturbing are not words to describe the visceral horror of this entire scene sequence. And the fact that the UFO is actually not just a spaceship but it\\'s an alien organism that disguises itself as a spaceship or flying saucer, that\\'s eerie as hell. And the extraterrestrial monster goes by a code name, Jean Jacket. And I was thinking all this time it was the name of the horse being sacrificed to the alien organism in the Star Lasso Experience scene.The climax scene was a bit too lengthy to achieve what it\\'s need to: Emerald lures the alien organism to a certain area so she can launch a giant floating blow-up balloon from Jupiter\\'s Claim up in the air to entice and kill the monster. While I thought this part of the film could\\'ve been executed with a bit more haste, the film\\'s end itself is a strong open ending. I do believe that her brother did survive and she\\'s not just imagining it, but yes it could be interpreted as a ghostly vision of her brother as there is a foggy mist engulfing the character to indicate he is dead from being consumed by the alien organism.Sound design (!), film editing (!), cinematography, production design, and visual effects (!) are impressive. After watching, I read a movie trivia article noting that the chimpanzee was created with motion capture technology. Super cool technical trivia to know.Peele\\'s films make you think, allowing for many plot elements and motifs in his films to be openly interpreted, and I like that he doesn\\'t settle for by-the-numbers supernatural exorcism horror or slasher films. For all sci-fi horror thriller enthusiasts, I recommend Nope. I eagerly await Peele\\'s next film project.'},\n",

This was a fiercely well made film and I think it\\'s the best that Jordan Peele\\'s given us so far. The thing that got me the most was the effects, the threat felt like it had a real presence in the world. It felt physical and ironically, not too floaty. The acting of course was great and the script had a good meld of genuinely funny moments, and some really effective ones. This has one really excellent scene that I think stands among some of the best horror I\\'ve watched. Now, just like \"Us\" from 2019, this movie did kind of lose me in the last quarter. It shifted from a thriller to more of an action film and there were parts where it felt a bit less special and more standard. I wish there was more hidden from us in the end, I didn\\'t want to get to know the threat as well as we did. I get that it\\'s a staple of abduction films but some of it was just too much, especially since that excellent scene I mentioned showed very little in terms of what we\\'re supposed to be scared of.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Director Jordan Peele practically dares Caucasian film critics to lambast this film, and they don\\'t take the bait. A testament to their cowardice.The story is of a Hollywood horse ranch that caters to the studio elites to perform acts so they can exploit them. There is some comparison to be drawn about all talent who perform in front of the lens. Specifically those who have no voice. That is the point of the Steven Yuen\\'s character who is a survivalist of one of the most bizarre Hollywood animal stories about a chimpanzee who ran amok on a late 90\\'s sitcom. He is relegated to the outskirts of Hollywood proper to run a corny ranch theme park that needs to be sponsored by local sci-fi nod landmarks such as Vasquez Rocks (for you cinephiles, the location of a LOT of \"Star Trek\" episodes). Daniel Kaluuya plays OJ Haywood. The great, great, great, GREAT grandson of the first African-American horse trainer and as their history is told to us, the jockey who was featured on the Edweard Muybridge persistence of vision horse gallop that kicked off motion pictures. There is pride in it...to a point. The declining ranch seems to be a boat anchor around his neck.When OJ\\'s father dies in some freak accident, OJ sets out to turn this tragedy into a sensationalized moment, where he attempts to gather proof that live beyond our planet exists. Unfortunately, his discovery leads to something much more eerie.Now, I suppose you would consider this dark comedy. But when Pops dies, very little is said about it, even less is the emotive state of his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) who seems to play the death off as if it were a minor convenience. Hard to empathize with people so dead in emotions, a close loved one passes without even a whimper. But that\\'s not this movie. It\\'s about the chase to get to notoriety. I think. Hard to say. Which is the downside of this flick. At some points it\\'s an indictment on fame and chasing it. At other times, it\\'s just survival ala \"War Of The Worlds\" In other parts, it\\'s just long lingering cinema that goes nowhere. As creepy as the windsocks that pepper the wastelands of the desert, this also seems like a very lonely venture for all involved. Having now lived in the San Fernando Valley, a TON of landmarks will be immortalized here. The Fry\\'s spaceship in Burbank, now abandoned and shut down. The obvious link to Calico (which is the site of Ricky Park\\'s theme...um park. Yes, the humor is THAT subtle.Some moments do become gruesome. Much never seen but implied. Like when the chimpanzee attacks his co-stars, Peele seems to relish in its primal violence. It\\'s dark and, if it draws laughs, I pity this universe.I do appreciate Peele for his love of cinema. He is obviously a student and at the top of his class. Yet, this falls empty and a very deep sense of sadness for those involved. For some this may play, for others it\\'s going to be a long slog.As some reviewer here has said, I too am grateful a filmmaker like Jordan Peele exists. He is the Cronenberg of our day. The horror drawn in the most mundane world. This is a very referential flick that, concurrently seems to be unique. I can\\'t draw on the influences directly, but the atmosphere is very familiar.All said, he does need to tighten the story a little. There is just so many beautiful melancholic images director of photography Hoyte Van Hoytema can capture. His exquisite use of landscape in a squarish format is much more interesting than shooting in, what we expect, \\'scope widescreen.

The effects were also pretty good when they were used. The monkey scenes were a little over my head as to how they fit into the story but were really intense. Chimp effect/suit was really good. Struggled to hear the dialogue in a lot of it too. I honestly had no idea how she ended up killing it in the end and had kind of lost interest at that point anyway.

Also I guess it\\'s an allegory for Hollywood being predatory for child actors? But also it\\'s about police brutality and black erasure, but you have to look those things up after the film. And then maybe on a rewatch you go, oh, yeah, I sorta see it?Those topics by the way? They are super worth bringing attention to. This is just a bad vehicle to do it with. In my opinion.Because you\\'re trying to load so many important topics at once, you end up with your audience going, so, is the Space Jellyfish supposed to be Hollywood, yet also police brutality? Are we filming Hollywood to prove its bad, while also praising Hollywood? Black Erasure from Hollywood history is bad, but isn\\'t Hollywood itself also a monster, so why would you want to be part of the monster...? If spectacle is bad, harming people in its pursuit, then why is this film itself trying to be a spectacle? And most crucially; Would an electric motor cycle really throw it\\'s rider off like that or would it just slowly come to a stop...?In my experience, when I\\'m questioning minutiae like that, I\\'m not really engaging with the film at all. I\\'m trying to piece together the directors point. Which really ideally should come after. Just me?It felt like the movie needed to pick a theme and hammer it home. Not pick several themes at once and see what sticks. Honestly, it feels like it kinda does a disservice to those topics. Had it been done better, maybe people would be talking about those topics more than how confused they were by the film and having to look up TMZ articles and clickbait YouTubers explaining the movie.Oh, also a chimpanzee kills a sitcom in the nineties? It doesn\\'t really matter, because, I think the surviving child actor now a grown man got eaten? Maybe? And BOY Somebody super didn\\'t like TMZ. Theybhated TMZ so much they wanted to have one of their faceless drone bike paparrazzi begging for their camera rather than begging to be saved from the Space Jellyfish. Garsh if that isn\\'t some biting social satire that totally didn\\'t make me groan...Going back to the chimpanzee. Sure there\\'s a tie in to Hollywood chewing up kid actors being made here, but like, why does that matter to the Space Jellyfish story? TMZ bit just felt like \"Paparazzi Bad\" and a personal beef maybe. I dunno.It\\'s fine but it needed to be like an hour shorter. Cut out the chimpanzee spree unless it has a more obvious link to the larger narrative which at present, it doesn\\'t.Larger Narrative. Not themes. If you want to tell a story about a kid who\\'s suffering PTSD from his Hollywood youth watching a chimpanzee murder spree? Ok, you do that. Might even be a good film in there. Dunston Checks Out, the Ape of Wrath, whatever... But maybe don\\'t leave it in as a half finished aside in your space Jellyfish story? Just, I guess focus on the Space Jellyfish...? I dunno, I\\'m not a film making guy.I almost want to give an extra star for the Akira bike slide because I\\'m an easily manipulated meat puppet who likes seeing things I recognise. But I\\'d instantly deduct that same star for the finale being a shrieking piece of CGI battling a balloon and losing.So, that was nope. It sorta happened. I\\'ve no desire to rewatch it again. Ever. But like, I kinda like the B-Movie vibes it was going for, I just wish they\\'d hired an editor for the script. Or at least I wish someone had, ironically, looked through the script and in a few places told the director \"Nope\".'},\n",

Fans of peele\\'s other movies who go in expecting to see a horror movie might be disappointed, because \"Nope\" isn\\'t super scary in the traditional sense. It\\'s more of a thriller- it\\'s really tense and kind of violent at times, with classic peele moments of comedic relief. I felt like the story line of this film had a nice solid arc to it, which was something i felt like was missing a little bit in \"Us.\" i left the theater immediately wanting to discuss the movie with somebody. Daniel kaluuya was fantastic as always, as was keke palmer. The title slides throughout were also very tarantino-esque.My only complaint, if you can even call it that, has to do with the whole jupe and gordy thing. I\\'ll admit that i don\\'t fully understand the significance of the gordy flashbacks. I understand that that event traumatized jupe as a child, but why was it shown twice? Clearly it holds some significance other than a general backstory to jupe\\'s character, but i don\\'t know what that is. Also, why was there a lone shoe on the ground standing up straight like that in that scene? It\\'s visible both in the opening of the film and when the scene plays out more fully later on. It seems like gordy was triggered by the balloons, so why is there a shoe basically floating? Is that some indication that there was extra terrestrial involvement in that whole incident? Also, i don\\'t fully understand the significance of jupe\\'s old coworker coming back for his live animal show towards the end. But either way, i don\\'t think these questions i have are indications of any shortcomings on peele\\'s end, per se. Some of it i just don\\'t feel smart enough to understand. But also, i feel like we could have benefited from a little more time spent on the whole jupe situation. Those are just my thoughts. Either way i loved it.

There's a lot of symbolism that supports the main theme. For instance how the characters must avoid looking directly at the alien, that represents spectacle, because it lures it to them. Therefore they succed by refusing their attachment to the spectacle.The main characters are also incredible, where the siblingpair of course steals the show. Their duality with Emerald being the extrovert and OJ being the introvert is very realistic and reminds me of the relationship between my sister and I. Keke Palmers energy is unmatched. She gives it all in every scene which just is delightful.There is a lot to extract from this movie, and if I adressed everything, you might fall asleep halfway through Reading it.

I also enjoyed Get Out, so i figured he would put together something about as good. When it started out, my excitement only built. I found the monkey gone rogue on set scene interesting, and my curiosity was piqued as to how it would tie in to whatever the alien thing was in the clouds. Likewise, all the other stuff going on in the first part of the movie had me excited to see where it was going to go.Only for it all to go... absolutely nowhere. The monkey scene stood alone at the end of a film as good representation of what much of the film ended up being. Just an odd, unexplained sequence that makes no sense at all. Why was that scene in the movie at all? I was busy trying to figure out what it meant, perhaps the alien could affect the minds of people/animals or something like that. But it had no relation to anything at all. Besides this, there were so so so many things the characters did that simply did not make sense at all. The transitions from one scene to the next became jarring and did not flow at all. We were thrown from one random encounter to the next, with no continuity or idea of what anything meant. Much of the dialogue was also very poor, just random comments that were filler or characters being unfunny.As for redeeming qualities of the film, it was visually very interesting to watch. The alien itself was very well-done at the end, and I loved the overall style in which the entire film was shot. The characters were interesting, but most of their roles were minimal and did not develop enough to where they could showcase their talents. This was particularly disappointing as I was looking forward to seeing what the 2 top actors and the top actress were going to bring to the table. But with uninspired script writing, it is hard to accurately grade their performances.Overall, I think this movie could have been very good. There were interesting ideas all over the place with great visuals, but these ideas were thrown together into a jumbled mess, with lack of a good script also hurting it a lot.'},\n",

Unfortunately, the most important and basic thing - the STORY - is a total mess. It feels like a 4 hour film that has had many important scenes cut out, and a lot of scenes that really should have been edited out left in. It's strange, because there is a decent film here trying to get out. A few reshoots and a brutal edit would have fixed it. Maybe no one at the studio dared to state the obvious.Minor characters wander in to the film and then disappear, but not before you've had all their backstory. The film meanders off into narrative dead ends, just so it can beat you over the head with it's none-too-original subtext. The main characters motivations are unclear, as are the stakes. Why are they even putting themselves in such danger, and not just walking away? The big emotional ending does not land, because you can't even figure out what the characters are feeling. The relationship between the siblings is not set up carefully. You can't connect on an emotional level. You don't feel anything, apart from 'Hey, that's a cool effect'. The internal rules of the film change to suit the plot. Gimmicky tributes to other, better, films are not enough to plug the leaks.It's a wannabe blockbuster with pretensions of depth.So, basically, the same problems that plagued every other Jordan Peele project except for 'Get Out'.

Nope on the other hand is a movie about a family's encounter with the extraterrestrial. Sounds interesting, until you realize that is ALL it's about.There are many story branches throughout the movie, though none of them amount to anything of significance or impact towards the main plot. Unfortunately Jordan Peele seems to have done this for two reasons. The first being shock and interest. The purposely vague and disorienting scenarios are there to disgust and scare the viewer. The film's genre of horror would be a suitable motivator for this decision. The second reason for these branches leading to nothing is simple - Time. Without adding random meaningless encounters, the film's runtime would be cut in half, or even less.The viewing as a whole is still enjoyable if you ignore these flaws and choose to focus on the positives. Nope's cinematography is unmatched and beautifully depicts rural life on a ranch. There are many different styles of filming applied here, and all of them are done well. Some scenes are gut wrenching and make you extremely uncomfortable, which of course is the intention.Before watching Nope, anything Jordan Peele touched turned to gold. This is no longer the case.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': \"Nope is an excellent film from Jordan Peele following his hits Get Out and Us. Nope is set in a western area, I think California, where this old western family makes a living raising horses on their ranch and working with filmmakers when they can.The family meets an unthinkable tragedy and the son OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) needs to take over. His sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) is somewhat of a firebrand with a big personality, while OJ is the quiet thoughtful type of leader who leads by example.From here on, it's hard to describe what happens without giving spoilers. The story becomes a weird game of cat and mouse between the ranch and some force. The viewer is trying to understand what's what until it gets pretty clearly revealed. Then it becomes a fight for survival.I loved Nope because the acting is top-notch. The way the sister and brother interact is just amazing - like they were real siblings who grew up fighting and were now adults trying to figure out how to fight. Other characters get pulled in with varying impacts on the story.The cinematography is big, again very big - sky-like big, with mountains. It's very western-like. There are often odd film angles from the sky or ground or under tables or from under buildings. It keeps the movie on edge. But it's the acting that delivers Nope. There's an old grizzled film guy who plays a role and boy, he's great, as the guy who has seen everything, until he finally meets something he's not seen. That scene is amazing.Nope will keep you on the edge of your seat and maybe even get you to scream out a few times, like I did. But it also gets you thinking about interactions between people to people, between people and animals, and that is pretty much what Director Peele wants to leave you thinking about.Nope is a good ole Sci-fi thriller that will leave you wanting more from this fine Director and this cast. I highly recommend Nope. All I can say is that I will no longer look at clouds the same way I used to...Nope.Enjoy.\"},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Jordan Peele\\'s latest horror film \"Nope\" has garnered mixed reactions since its release, with some praising its visual style and performances, while others criticize its confusing storyline, inconsistent tone, and shallow social commentary.The opening quote of the film, \"I will cast abominable filth upon you, make you vile, and make you a spectacle. - Nahum 3:6\", sets the tone for the exploration of spectacle throughout the movie. The Haywood siblings\\' pursuit of capturing footage of the UFO and Ricky\\'s traumatic experience with Gordy\\'s rampage poke at the unhealthy relationship between society and spectacle.Despite the film\\'s beautiful and surreal visuals, the storyline is often convoluted and confusing, with a central mystery that fails to maintain viewer interest throughout its runtime. The humor is tonally inconsistent with the horror elements, resulting in a jarring and confusing viewing experience. The social commentary, while exploring themes such as income inequality, societal divisions, and the impact of technology on modern life, is criticized for being shallow and overly simplistic. The depiction of technology as a source of fear and anxiety lacks nuance and exploration.Moreover, the pacing of the film is slow and meandering, with scenes that feel drawn out and unnecessary. The ending is unsatisfying, leaving audiences with more questions than answers and a feeling of disappointment and unfulfillment.However, \"Nope\" still manages to spark conversations about society\\'s obsession with spectacle and the media\\'s tendency to sensationalize tragedy. Peele\\'s exploration of these themes may not be as clear as in his previous films, but it still invites viewers to think deeper about their own relationship with spectacle and the impact it has on society.'},\n",

I think this is a step forward from his last feature US, it's a far cry from his break out hit GET OUT. I'll keep the story a secret as the movie makes a great deal of it unfolding, so I'll just state my frustrations here. Peele is enormously gifted, but once the movie unveils the premise, it never feels like it lives up to the hype. Perhaps it's the shifting tones and influences, the unneeded chapter titles, the characters that are hard to connect with, that it drags like crazy in the third act, or any number of things that just never clicked - but I suppose I could overlook it if I just connected with the basic story being told and the family its being told through.

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'IN A NUTSHELL:\\nThere\\'s been a lot of buzz about this movie, so I was excited to see it. Some are even calling Jordan Peele the next M. Night Shyamalan. He wrote AND directed the movie. The story is fairly simple, yet packs a punch once the action finally hits. It\\'s about a small town in inland California that witnesses a chilling spectacle.THINGS I LIKED:\\nDaniel Kaluuya is such a versatile actor and deserving of his Oscar nomination for his work in Get Out.I really liked Keke Palmer in this role. Everyone else in the cast did a great job, including Steven Yeun, Brandon Perea, and Keith David.The movie takes place in Agua Dulce, California. The home and ranch were created specifically for the movie. Apparently, Jordan Peele liked the area because so many set designers and crew members that work in Hollywood live out there.There\\'s a quote at the beginning of the movie from the book of Nahum in the Old Testament. The story in the Bible is about how God will \"make spectacles\" of the people of the city of Nineveh because of their wickedness. If you\\'re familiar with the scriptures, you\\'ll see some similarities in this movie.This is the first horror film in history to be filmed with IMAX cameras!If you\\'re a fan of the movie Akira, you\\'ll see some respectful nods to scenes in that film, which is one of Jordan Peele\\'s favorites.Did you know Fry\\'s Electronics went out of business? I didn\\'t! We had a gigantic one here in Las Vegas where I live, and it was really cool. Too bad. The store is featured in the movie but closed before the movie\\'s release.I love it when directors include lots of details and visual cues for audiences. For example, in this movie, you\\'ll see thematic images in the sky, popping balloons, old-timey record players, and cowboy motif to contrast with the space alien/creature.The light humor is always welcome.There are so many night scenes that are filmed really well. Great job with cinematography!Similar to M. Night Shyamalan\\'s movies, you\\'re often shown only part of a scene to increase tension and intrigue. The camera often moves slowly as it pans a scene but then suddenly transitions into another scene, leaving you wondering what happened.THINGS I DIDN\\'T LIKE:\\nThe movie is VERY slow-moving. Not much \"happens\" for an entire hour and 20 minutes!Is this a horror or sci-fi thriller or psychological drama or social commentary or all of the above?There are some plot holes that remain unanswered.This is one of those movies where you can run to the restroom several times or even doze off and not really miss anything for large swatches of time.You could easily tell that the chimpanzee wasn\\'t a real animal but motion capture.There are some flashbacks that might confuse viewers.There are plenty of interesting connections, but they\\'re often so subtle that audiences won\\'t get them.No end-credit scene.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\\nViolence\\nProfanity and lots of F-bombs\\nBlood and gore\\nA female character smokes a lot\\nA vicious monkey kills people.High dead body count\\nBlood rain and poopTHEMES:\\nJordan Peele described a big theme in the movie as \"addiction to spectacle\"\\nWonder\\nFamily\\nLegacy\\nTrying to control nature and animals\\nTrying to profit from spectacles\\nNature photographyYou can see the full review on the Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'You\\'ve seen Jaws, right? Then you\\'ve seen Nope. Even down to the way they kill the creature. The premise is a interesting take on what UFO\\'s could be (Jack Arnold was convinced that he saw living things not flying saucers back in 1947), but there are these two half baked story lines crammed together uncomfortably - with one of them just being dropped because of a miscalculation in a theme park. Also, the way you stop an animal from attacking or getting spooked is by not looking at it in the eyes? All right, but where were the eyes on the thing that everyone is supposed to avoid?Let\\'s not mention the heavy handed commentary on the trials and tribulations of filming and fame. You\\'ll know what I mean by the TMZ segment. It was like the movie slowed down an action sequence to reenact the lyrics to Hotel California. There is another potentially heavy handed idea that \"Jean Jacket\" (yes the creature is dubbed Jean Jacket in reference to a horse that wouldn\\'t be bridled) could be mistaken for a angel. At the end of the film it unfurls itself to look like some sort of giant gossamer parachute organism. Why? In the words of The Critical Drinker; \"Don\\'t know\". You didn\\'t see it look like that before but I guess you have to go the Theme Park route for a film climax.And just like Jaws, there is already talk of a Nope II. Hey Jordan, I\\'ll give you this one for free - why not call it \"Nah\" and go work on something original.'},\n",

       "  'Текст отзыва': 'Something that has never been done before. A story that has never been told. With classic Peele flare, this film perfectly wove together multiple stories and ideas with blinding symbolism. Absolutely beautifully shot. One of the best movies I have ever seen.Things I loved about this movie (SPOILERS):1. The underlying story of a black family training horses for Hollywood for generations, in what I assume is a white dominated field. This raised the stakes, created character development, and told a uniquely heartwarming story we haven\\'t heard before. Once again, Peele beautifully underpins a black story within a unique horror space.2. Themes. So many themes, perfectly mirrored and interlaced throughout the film. The Theme of Hollywood and \"Spectacle\" . A cautionary tale not to lose yourself and sacrifice everything for the perfect shot or fame. A theme we see with so many characters in this film---Jupe, Emerald, Holst, and the TMZ motorcyclist.A cautionary tale about man\\'s hubristic relationships with powerful creatures--horses, chimps, aliens, etc. We see characters taking advantage of these creatures and exercising supremacy--all for the Spectacle--and all to their demise. Except OJ, whose compassion and familial relationship with his horses allows him to triumph.3. The terrifying horror scenes. The Gordy Show massacre and the Jupe Ranch spectators dying screaming while being devoured by the creature will haunt me forever.4. The humor that cut the tension without taking away from the horror.5. Peele\\'s flare for inserting a real life event into the fictional world blurring the lines of reality. Charla Nash was mauled by a pet chimp in 2009. She appeared on Oprah (who is mentioned a few times in the movie) wearing almost the same outfit as Mary Jo at the Jupe ranch.6. The amazing cinematography and tension building. The scenes of powerful horses running through the sprawling wild country. The kitschy Jupe Park that created foreboding. The shots of the power surges and tube men falling to the gourd. And of course, the creature--a biblical and truly terrifying monster.7. The witty title.This film says SOOO much you won\\'t catch it all while you\\'re watching it. It will seep into you slowly and you will realize, after proper reflection, it is a masterpiece.'},\n",
